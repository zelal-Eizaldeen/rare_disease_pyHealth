Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ was admitted to Urology with a RIGHT renal mass after undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events occurred please see dictated operative note for details. The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated with intravenous fluids keeping urine output at over >30cc/hour. She provided with pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient was transitioned from PCA to oral medications with the advancement to clears diet. She poorly tolerated the narcotics which caused dizziness, nausea and a general \"unwell\" feeling. She did not have emesis but did experience periorid nausea. This limited her cooperation with early mobilization and deep inspiration, incentive spirometry use. She is known to have obstructive sleep apnea and was maintained on telemetry for continuous oxygen saturation monitoring and provided CPAP and nasal canula use for overnight. She was given additional pain medications and anti-emetics and subsequently ambulated and advanced to clears with toast and crackers. She was not given Toradol because of her POD1 creatinine. At her request her narcotics were adjusted. Basic metabolic panel and complete blood count were checked daily. On POD2 her pain was moderately well controlled ranging from ___. Ms. ___ ambulated and continued to use the incentive spirometer. She was able to ambulate on room air without requirement of supplemental oxygen to keep her saturation greater than 92%. She did not feel well enough to go home and remained overnight.",

Her blood pressures were quite elevated (150-170/90-110) on admission, requireing 30mg of IV Labetolol. Preeclampsia labs were normal. Her blood pressures improved and she was continued on po Labetolol. Fetal testing was reassuring. The etiology of her nausea/vomiting was unclear. She was given antiemetics. After close monitoring on labor and delivery, she was transferred to the antepartum floor for observation and a 24 hour urine collection to rule out superimposed preeclampsia. On HD#2, her blood pressures remained elevated and she developed a headache. Given her hypertension and symptoms, the decision was made to proceed with induction of labor.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST 1. Re-demonstration of subarachnoid hemorrhage over the left parietal convexity. No new foci of hemorrhage. 2. No evidence of mass, infarct, or abnormal enhancement after contrast administration. Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history notable for fibromyalgia and abnormal muscle biopsy who presents with 3 days of severe abrupt-onset headaches, found to have convexal SAH on CT imaging at OSH. Follow-up MRI redemonstrated cSAH without evidence of underlying mass, vascular malformation, or microhemorrhages. Accordingly, in the absence of anatomic or traumatic etiologies for the cSAH, suspicion was raised for reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Although Ms. ___ did not report recent changes to her SSRI, SSRI medications have been associated with worsening RCVS, so her escitalopram was discontinued.

She was also found to have hematuria with unremarkable sediment. #Recurrent Fevers Patient reported fevers up to ___ for 9 days preceding admission, and 1 week of similar fevers in ___ which was attributed to viral illness. There was initial concern for temporal arteritis given L temporal soreness, fevers, and elevated CRP/ESR. Rheumatology was consulted and the decision was made to defer steroids as GCA was unlikely (no visual loss, jaw claudication, progression, or other features c/w vasculitis). Malignancy was considered but thought to also be less likely given unremarkable differential, absence of LAD, and no concerning findings on admission CT chest. Does have a remote",

The patient had no significant improvement with antibiotics to cover for CAP organisms, nor with high-dose IV steroids (methylpred 125 BID) during this hospitalization. Abx were stopped after 4 days. Solumedrol was decreased to prednisone 50 mg daily upon discharge and he was started on prophylaxis for projected long-term steroids use with atovaquone & omeprazole, and was continued on home calcium & vitamin D. The Pulmonology team harbored high suspicion that the patient's IPF may be due to short telomere syndrome, given the lack of other positive tests results and due to a family history of two maternal relatives (mother, aunt) with ILD plus early development of white hair. Thus, they advised initiating danazol, 400 mg BID, at least until the diagnosis of short telomere syndrome is ruled in or out with appropriate genetic testing.

At his initial appointment, the patient appeared jaundiced. Labs on ___ revealed a bilirubin of 4. 7. Abdominal ultrasound on ___, at ___ revealed a 4-cm hypoechoic mass in the pancreas with biliary duct dilatation. The liver was mildly echogenic. CT scan on ___, at ___ demonstrated a mass in the head of the pancreas measuring 4. 7 cm, common bile duct dilated to 15 mm, and the liver was felt to be filled with small nodules representing metastatic disease. Additional blood work on ___, showed that the CA-19 was slightly above normal at 43. The patient was referred to Dr. ___ on an urgent basis who performed ERCP on ___. There was a 2-cm stricture in the common bile duct due to extrinsic compression from the pancreatic head mass. A plastic biliary stent was placed. Brushings were obtained. Unfortunately, cytology was not diagnostic. His bilirubin had climbed to 5. 8 pre-procedure, the next day it dropped to 3. 2, and later to 2. 0. I first met the patient on ___. We discussed the possibilities, a likely diagnosis being that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma however, we did discuss that other rare causes of pancreatic masses include neuroendocrine tumors and also lymphoma. The patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the liver at ___ on ___. Pathology returned on ___, demonstrating poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. The tumor cells were described as small with scant cytoplasm. They were positive for CDX2, CD56, cytokeratin, with patchy and weak staining for synaptophysin and chromogranin. The tumors were negative for CK20 and CK7. Ki-67 was greater than 90%. Within the liver, the neuroendocrine carcinoma was predominantly within the portal vessels.

The left kidney is severely atrophic with severe thinning of the cortical parenchyma and  hydronephrosis with foci of calcification within the dependent portion of the lower pole calyces. Stranding of fat surrounding the left proximal ureter as well as ill-defined soft tissue stranding within the ipsilateral psoas muscle adjacent to the proximal ureter and enhancing lymph nodes in the left para-aortic region measuring up to 1 cm in short axis raise suspicion for chronic infection as an etiology for the above described findings. Comparison with any prior imaging if available is recommended to ascertain the exact cause for chronic renal atrophy on the left. 4.

Botulinum toxin injections can increase jitter in muscles distant from the site of injection. There is no electrophysiologic evidence for a generalized disorder of motor neurons as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. CT abdomen ___ IMPRESSION: 1. No clear evidence to suggest malignancy in the abdomen or pelvis. 2. Distended gall bladder filled with stones. Trace inflammatory change immediately posterior to the GB. These findings raise concern for but are not entirely diagnostic of acute cholecystitis. If patient has abnormal LFT's or right upper quadrant tenderness, further evaluation with ultrasound is recommended. CT Chest ___ IMPRESSION: 1. 3. 2-cm (TRV) x 4. 1-cm (AP) x 4. 7-cm (CC) heterogeneous mass in the region of the left lobe of the thyroid (3 8), which laterally displaces the left carotid from the larynx, and may invade the cricoid cartilage, cricopharyngeus, upper esophagus, innominate and left subclavian arteries. NOTE: This could be secondary to thyroid cancer, however this mass is highly concerning for a squamous cell carcinoma. A dedicated neck CT is recommended for further evaluation. 2. Multiple nodules in the right lung measuring up to 5-mm. Given that the neck mass is highly suspicious for malignancy, a 6-month follow up is recommended to assess for stability of the nodules. CT Neck ___ IMPRESSION:  4. 6 cm mass adjacent to or arising from the left lobe of the thyroid. Further characterization with ultrasound can be considered, but ultimately biopsy would be required for definitive diagnosis. No cervical lymphadenopathy.

In place of cytoreduction followed by non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant, he elected to enroll in a trial of Velcade and Revlimid at ___, completing 5 cycles prior to withdrawal due to several adverse effects (peripheral neuropathy, weight loss, nausea, gastritis), with partial response. When PET-CT in ___ revealed increased retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy with associated rise in creatinine, he was treated with Bendamustine/Rituxan x5, beginning in ___. Although colonoscopy in ___ revealed mantle cell lymphomatous involvement, he opted for continued surveillance at that time. In ___, he developed fatigue, fevers, and abdominal pain in the setting of cytopenias and rising LDH, prompting Bendamustine/Rituxan after x5. Most recently, CT abdomen/pelvis on ___ in the setting of worsening diffuse abdominal pain (particularly intense in the evening and exacerbated by lying down), nausea, and intermittent emesis x1-2 weeks revealed progression of his disease.

FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED. ACID FAST SMEAR (Final ___: NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR. ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary): Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o M with presumed cirrhosis, DMII, EtOH abuse, COPD with long and complicated outside hospital MICU course transferred to ___ MICU for thoracic surgery evaluation of llarge RUL lung abscess. He was not felt to be a surgical candidate. He continued to have persistent fevers and leukocytosis despite targeted antibiotics. The decision was made for comfort measures only and he expired. ACTIVE ISSUES: # Sepsis with pulmonary source He presented with sepsis evidenced by fever on arrival to MICU along with worsening leukocytosis to 20k. He had been off pressors since ___ at the OSH. He has multiple sources, but most notable and likely being the RUL abscess and multifocal pneumonia. OSH cultures grew aspergillus and enterbacter from the abscess and serratia from sputum. He was treated with voriconazole for aspergillus, meropenm for enterobacter and serratia, and tobramycin for presumed VAP. Vancomycin was not initially continued, but he had a subsequent rising leukocytosis so this was added. Here, he grew pseudomonas and acitentobacter from sputum. ID was consulted for assistance with antibiotics he had multiple organisms with different sensitivity profiles, so antibiotics were targeted while balancing minimizing toxicity. However, source control was unable to be achieved given poor surgical candidacy. A family meeting was held given his poor prognosis and they and the patient reiterated that he did not want to be dependent upon the ventilator/HD and he was transitioned to comfort measures only and subsequently expired. # Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure He underwent trach placement and remains ventilator dependent upon admission from OSH. Etiology multifactorial but most",

A1c PEND FLP: Tc=227, ___, HDL=108, LDL=112 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is an ___ year old right handed woman with history of HTN and stroke/ICH in ___ who presents after a transient episode of R facial droop, R hand weakness, and dysarthria at 11am. # INTRAPARENCHYMAL HEMORRHAGE: MRI studies were demonstrated which demonstrated no new ischemia but the previously noted left intraparenchymal hemorrhage likely unchanged from prior ___ with associated naming/paraphasic errors which persisted through hospitalization. The patient's daughter, ___ noted a prior study performed at ___ which  demonstrated a hemorrhage of similar size. # CONCERN FOR SEIZURE: Given the patient's evidence on MRI of amyloid angiopathy it is possible that her  transient symptoms occurring in the right body may be secondary to new seizure activity which has been well known to occur after intracranial bleeds. As a result of this electroencephalogram (EEG) study obtained and started Keppra 750mg BID. # RISK FACTOR STRATIFICATION:  The patient's A1c was pending at the time of discharge, and FLP demonstrated elevated LDL which will be treated as outpatient.

MRI Head:  Rads read pending on discharge. On our review showed a large (4. 5 cm x 5. 5 cm) extra-axial, parasagittal lesion causing mass effect on the left frontal lobe and left lateral ventricle. No surrounding edema, no midline shift or hydrocephalus. The lesion is diffusely contrast enhancing, and seems c/w a meningioma Brief Hospital Course: Pt. was admitted to the Neurology service after a right sided focal motor seizure at home. On neurologic exam she had very subtle UMN pattern weakness in her right leg, but otherwise a normal exam (MS was intact, no evidence of papilledema)  MRI of the head performed and showed a large parasagittal extra-axial lesion in the left frontal lobe, which seemed most c/w a meningioma (see results above). This was felt to be the likely etiology of her seizure. She had no further events in house. She was started on Keppra 500 mg BID, with instructions to titrate up over the next week to 1000 mg BID. Neurosurgery was contacted and reviewed her MRI, and agreed that meningioma was most likely. They recommended that she see Dr. ___ in clinic in the next ___ weeks to discuss resection. The pt. requested to have as much of the work up done outpatient as possible, as her husband is very ill and she wants to be with him as much as possible. As her exam was reassuring and Neurosurgery agreed that close outpatient follow up was reasonable, she was discharged home on HOD #2. She was instructed not to drive per ___ Law.

Patient is prescribed narcotics and benzodiazepines for history of chronic lower back pain. He initially was altered, violent, had metabolic acidosis, and positive drug screen. He was seen by psychiatry, placed on ___, monitored in the ER for approximately 24 hours before being admitted to medicine. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, kidney injury and electrolyte abnormalities all which resolved with IVF and electrolytes. He was given high dose thiamine and other vitamins given his AMS. He was evaluated by the toxicology team as well who provided recommendations. Patient's mental status resolved and he met with ___ attending and social worker regarding transition of care out of the hospital. The patient was not interested in drug counseling, or programs associated with drug abuse. He also refused housing resources. He was assessed on ___ and found to have capacity and discharged from the hospital without any refills for his narcotic or benzodiazepine medications. Due to rib fractures found on imaging, which may be chronic patient was referred to trauma service as an outpatient. # AMS ___ toxic drug ingestion: Patient presented with confusion, slurred speech, in setting of positive drug screen (benzos, methadone, opioids). Given h/o polysubstance abuse and positive tox screen this is most likely etiology of patient's AMS. Patient was afebrile, near normal white count, and normal u/a making occult infection less likely possibility for patient's AMS. Underlying psych disorder is also a consideration, however, there is no prior h/o psychiatric illness and this is difficult to assess in setting of likely intoxication. Other concerning possibilities would be Wernicke encephalopathy in context of alcohol use and due to ongoing confabulation. Given improving mental status, he was evaluated by social worker on ___. Psychiatry assessment was also requested. ___ was lifted prior to discharge. Patient declined all social work resources but agreed to follow up with a social worker in ___. # Rhabdomyolysis and ___: Patient with creatinine to 2. 4 on admission, improved to 0. 8 with IVF. Patient with likely pre-renal azotemia ___ to poor PO intake in setting of intoxication. Additionally, patient with elevated CK, reportedly after being assaulted day prior. Patient may have some level of rhabdo ___ injury and/or being down while intoxicated / confused. His CK on ___ was <3000, and so IVF were stopped and patient encouraged to take in adequate PO intake. Creatinine of 0. 6 prior to discharge. # Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mild AG metabolic acidosis (AG = 16) at admission that was likely secondary to ___ as noted above. Improved with IVF. # Transaminitis: Patient had elevated AST/ALT at admission, likely related to both drug effect and in context of rhabdomyolysis. He had negative ethanol screen. CT abdomen/pelvis was without evidence of liver laceration. # Rib fractures: Likely chronic given only minimal pain. Patient can be referred to trauma surgery as an outpatient if necessary after PCP ___.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is an ___ yo woman with a  h/o Coumadin anticoagulation and Alzheimer's who presented with weakness, slurred speech, and RUE swelling and was found to have an INR 20, sublingual hematoma, and RUE hematoma. # Increased INR: Her supratherapeutic INR was most likely due to receiving 7. 5mg instead of 2. 5mg daily of Coumadin, per family interview about home dosing of coumadin. It remained unclear for how long the wrong dosing had been occurring. It was also possible that interaction with Bactrim or other medication (memantidine most recently new) or changes in diet may have further complicated her coagulopathy. Interaction with Bactrim seemed unlikely given time course of elevated INR (INR 2 wks ago was supratherapeutic at 3. 5. ) In anticipation of the need for a transfusion, she was typed and crossed for 2 units PRBCs on admission. 4 units of FFP were given on arrival to the ICU, and she had also received 10mg IV Vit K in ED. After these therapies, her INR came down to 1. 3. She was tranfered out of the ICU on the day after admission, and she was restarted on her home dose of coumadin. On hospital day 3 (___), her INR had increased to 2. 2, which was greater than had been expected for a single administration. It was decided that resuming coumadin therapy should be addressed by her PCP on an outpatient basis. On the day of discharge, her INR was 3. 3.",

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain. A cardiac work up remained negative, however a chest x-ray revealed air in the space surrounding your lungs, called pneumothorax. Fortunately, this resolved on its own with rest and oxygen.

ACUTE ISSUES: ===================== # Fever -  The patient initially presented with fevers to 104. 0, dyspnea and cyanosis at home. He was treated for CHF exacerbation and pneumonia with initial improvement in his sxs despite unimpressive CXR. His urine and blood cultures returned negative. His fever is not consistent with fever of unknown origin as that would require a duration of 3 weeks with no known source. The patient was afebrile during the hospitalization and antibiotics were discontinued on ___ without return of fever. Repeat chest x-ray showed no signs of pneumonia, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. Urine culture showed no growth. Patient's presentation was most consistent with a viral lower respiratory infection triggering afib with RVR and a CHF exacerbation, which had been controlled prior to transfer. However, given the association with a new onset eruptive rash, immune or vascular etiologies were considered, and biopsies were taken by dermatology as below. # Rash - Patient was transferred from ___ because of concern that his skin rash was consistent with a vasculitis or autoimmune disorder. The rash consists of red papules ~0. 5mm in diameter and looks to be consistent with cherry hemangiomas, which dermatology consult agredd with. However, the reason for a sudden eruption was unclear. Per dermatology, this could be seen with medications or multiple myeloma. Patient recently took a course of bactrim for UTI. Skin biopsies were taken, and pathology confirmed cherry hemangiomas. SPEP and UPEP were pending on discharge, and patient's PCP ___ with results. # Left renal thickening - There was concern by ___ Urology, Dr. ___ renal stone given fever and abnormal findings on CT abd/pelvis, which was done with contrast. He requested a repeat CT w/o to look for stones and urine cytology. CT w/o contrast confirmed lack of stone. He has ___ appointment with urology to ___ the left renal thickening. # CAD - Patient had 6 vessel CABG many years ago (unclear how many). He did not have any chest pain during the admission. The patient had nonspecific ST changes as well as TWI on EKG which were thought to be due to memory T waves, however given his history he underwent a pharmacologic stress echo. This demonstrated no diagnostic ECG changes but with possible 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to pharmacologic stress. On further discussion with the reading cardiologist, given his presentation this was thought to be unlikely due to CAD/ischemia, may be due to image quality/off axis imaging. His medical regimen was therefore optimized, afib treated as below and cardiology f/u scheduled. Home aspirin, metoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate were continued during admission. # Afib: New onset since arrival at ___.

He requested a repeat CT w/o to look for stones and urine cytology. CT w/o contrast confirmed lack of stone. He has ___ appointment with urology to ___ the left renal thickening. # CAD - Patient had 6 vessel CABG many years ago (unclear how many). He did not have any chest pain during the admission. The patient had nonspecific ST changes as well as TWI on EKG which were thought to be due to memory T waves, however given his history he underwent a pharmacologic stress echo. This demonstrated no diagnostic ECG changes but with possible 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to pharmacologic stress. On further discussion with the reading cardiologist, given his presentation this was thought to be unlikely due to CAD/ischemia, may be due to image quality/off axis imaging. His medical regimen was therefore optimized, afib treated as below and cardiology f/u scheduled. Home aspirin, metoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate were continued during admission. # Afib: New onset since arrival at ___. EKG done on the floor was consistent with coarse a. fib, and was reviewed with cardiology given new TWI, thought to be due to memory t waves in the setting of recent pacing. The patient now has a CHADS2 score of 3 based on CHF, HTN and A. fib as well as possible new onset diabetes (see issue of HBA1c below). He was started on warfarin prior to discharge and will ___ with his PCP for management.",

Cardiac biopsy showed non-specific interstitial fibrotic changes, final cardiac MRI read was consistent with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy but otherwise non-specific. His medications were titrated and he was ultimately discharged on a regimen of torsemide 10mg PO every other day, lisinopril 20 mg PO QD, and Metoprolol Succinate XL 12. 5 mg. He was trialed on both spironolactone and digoxin while inpatient, but ultimately these were stopped secondary to persistent hyperkalemia. He was discharged euvolemic with a dry weight of 80. 65 kg (177. 8 lb). #Hyperkalemia The patient's potassium spiked to 5.",

Original symptoms improved with 2 combivnet nebs. She received ceftriaxone 1g x 1 and azithromycin 500mg PO x 1 because of concern for PNA. A CTA was performed and prelim read was no PE. However, the study showed new mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing lingular and left upper lobe collapse as well as a destructive lesion centered in the right third rib with invasion into the adjacent anterior chest wall and pulmonary parenchyma. She was initially admitted to OMED but immediately triggered twice for respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU. There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed that the right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor, and also revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with bronchomalacia of the left mainstem that resulted in complete occlusion of the airway on exhalation. She was then transferred to the ___ for rigid bronchoscopy, which was performed on ___. Endobronchial tumor was debrided with APC and a Y-stent was deployed successfully. During her ICU course she was started on levo/flagyl for empiric treatment of post-obstructive PNA, but given her lack of fevers/WBC/cough, these were d/c'ed on antibiotic day #4.

Initial suspicion for meningitis in the ED and patient given ceftriaxone and vancomycin prior to arrival to the medical floor (pt refused LP). Clinical suspicion for menigitis was very low by the time of the patient's admission to the floor, so antibiotics were discontinued. Malaria was also entertained given prior traveling history and lack of prophylaxis, but smears were negative times four. Pt did not receive any pretrip vaccinations. Time line of presentation inconsistent with dengue. Typhoid fever and yellow fever also thought to be less likely. Full infection workup, including blood cultures, urine analysis, chest radiograph, liver function tests, and infectious labs - including viral hepatitis (A,C,D,E), EBv, toxo, CMV - were all negative. With supportive care and fluid, the patient's fevers resolved and  symptoms significantly improved by hospital day three. Patient was discharged home with PCP follow up.. #Tachycardia: On admission patient was tachycardic to the 120s which responded well to IV fluid boluses. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia. Differential for tachycardia included fever, infectious process, anxiety, and hyperthyroidism. TSH was sent which came back as 0. 031 with T4 of 7. 9 which suggested subcllinical hyperthyrodism for which patient will follow up with his PCP for further management. On the day of discharge patient's heart rate had decreased to normal ranges of ___.. Transition of care: Pending Labs: Blood Cultures with no growth to date.

Unfortunately, ___ is nonverbal at baseline and he is not accompanied by his caregiver from his residential group home. I attempted to call her but was unable to reach her. Per OSH records, he was in his usual state of health this morning until ~11:50 when he had a coughing fit followed by a period of unresponsiveness. His caregiver thought that he was possibly having a seizure, as this looked similar to his seizures in the past, so he was brought to ___. There, he continued to be \"out of it\" so underwent a ___ CT which revealed loss of the gray-white junction in the R MCA territory in addition to a hyperdensity in the R MCA at the bifurcation (M1) -- suspicious for a thrombus. TeleStroke was called and Dr. ___ noted a right gaze deviation as well as LUE flaccidity (both new, per his caregiver -- especially his LUE tone, as he is usually contracted with hypertonia throughout). He was loaded with tPA at 14:50 and then transferred to ___ ED for further cares. Of note, at baseline, ___ is mostly nonverbal other than unintelligible grunting/vocalizations and 1 or 2 words.

VIRAL CULTURE: R/O HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS : No Virus isolated.. ___ G & C SWAB : Chlamydia trachomatis, Nucleic Acid Probe, with Amplification: Negative for Chlamydia trachomatis by PCR. NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE (GC), NUCLEIC ACID PROBE, WITH AMPLIFICATION :Negative for Neisseria Gonorrhoeae by PCR.. ___ URINE CULTURE: URINE CULTURE -w/MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. Brief Hospital Course: In summary, the patient is a ___ female who presented with 1 week of worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea.. # Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea: After an extensive imaging and lab work-up the patient's abdominal pain etiology was still unclear. Work-up data with transvaginal ultrasound, abdominal & pelvic CT, vaginal swabs, and blood labs all essentially ruled out endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts w/torsion, ectopic pregnancy, GC/Chlamydia, appendicitis, kidney stones, colon pathology. Despite her benign gynecologic lab/imaging workup she had some mild tenderness on pelvic exam at her cervix. Thus, she was treated empirically for PID with Doxycycline and Cefotexan and advised that if this pain did not resolve or if she noticed any unusual odor, discharge or bleeding that she needed to follow-up with her primary care physician or see ___ gynecologist as soon as possible.. Ultimately, based on the temporality and description of watery diarrhea it was felt that Ms. ___ have been experiencing a form of viral gastroenteritis, though the prominent abdominal pain was fairly atypical. Moreover, viral gastroenteritis is frequently associated with brief elevations in lipase which was noted with Ms. ___ labs with a lipase of 99. Pancreatitis was unlikely as her symptoms appeared to quickly resolve and she was able to tolerate a regular diet well within hours of her admission. Abdominal CT also showed no radiological signs of pancreatitis. Initially, vasculitis was considered but felt to be less likely based on normal ESR and guaiac negative stool. A rarer cause such as porphyria was briefly entrtained but this is usually more chronic, relapsing abdominal pain, often with neurological symptoms which the patient lacked. Lastly, the team considered IBD as an etiology given the component of diarrhea, but this was also doubted as IBD usually presents less acutely with a more chronic course.. Upon admission she was initially placed on clear liquids but soon advanced to a regular diet which she tolerated very well with no additional diarrhea or vomiting and very minimal nausea. She was given additional IVFs for basic rehydration. For abdominal pain control she was given low doses of IV Dilaudid and then switched to PRN oral oxycodone. Compazine was given for nausea relief and Ativan was also given for dual anxiety and anti-nausea effects. Stool cultures and labs were ordered but the patient's diarrhea seemed to have abated after admission. She stated that she was not usually able to go to the bathroom in hospitals and had \"trouble\" feeling comfortable enough to have a bowel movement. Unfortunately, as sample was not collected but given the patient's desire to be discharged and her rapid clinical improvement she was not kept in the hospital simply to collect these studies. She was told, however, that if her diarrhea returned that she should return to the ED or call her primary care provider as stool studies would be an important part of the workup. At time of discharge home she was pain free and her nausea was nearly gone. She had no residual cramping or emesis either and she appeared much more alert and hydrated with moist mucous membranes and a less pallid complexion. She was asked to continue Tylenol as needed OTC for a week for any residual abdominal pain but not to exceed 3g/day.. # Anxiety - During her hospital course she was given Ativan ___ mg PO every 4 hours as needed for anxiety. She denied any suicidal or homicidal thoughts but seemed to have a sad, flat affect. She reported no hallucinations or changes in her eating or sleeping habits. She described her mood as \"steady\" but explained she still got sad at times. She explained that she felt she did not need her Klonopin anymore so she had gradually tapered herself off of it over a period of ___ weeks. She took",

The patient notes awakening from sleep on ___ at roughly 01:00 and at that time noticed burning pain above and below both eyes which lasted for perhaps 1 minute and associated with this noted that her left arm was floppy and her left hand was clumsy. She ten went back to sleep and on waking at 07:00 she felt better, ate breakfast normally but then at roughly noon felt non-specifically unwell. This is in contrast to OSH admission history which relayed that when she woke up in the morning her left arm was still weak and persisted all day and she was not able to pick up any objects with the left hand due of the weakness. In addition, she also noted some weakness in her left leg and had some difficulty walking as a result. She then had great difficulty getting dressed taking apparently the \"whole afternoon\" according to the patient which was very unusual for her. Her daughter was concerned and took her to ___. She denied sensory symptoms but does have a chronic dull ache in her left leg and lower back and this had not changed. At ___, her BP was controlled and she was noted to have Left arm and leg weakness and went on to have a NCHCT which revealed a prior left thalamic lacunar infarct but otherwise no major abnormalities and the patient was started on aspirin. She was seen by neurology, Dr ___ who felt this may be a capsular infarct and recommended an MRI. This revealed multiple acute regions of diffusion restriction including lesions in the right pons and scattered infarcts in both hemispheres. The etiology was presumed embolic, and the patient was started on a heparin gtt on ___ and aspirin stopped with a maximum PTT of 58. The OSH neurologist reviewed her MRI and subsequently the heparin was stopped and the patient switched to aspirin 325mg daily alone due to several spots of GRE/susceptibility artifact",

Arthrocentesis performed in the ___ showed right knee with 40,000 WBC and 16,000 RBC and left knee with 32,000 WBC and 2200 RBC. Though this was not quite in range for septic arthritis, it was felt to be possible since she did reiceve one dose ceftriaxone at ___ before arhtrocentesis was performed in ___. Due to suspicious for septic arthritis, she was empirically covered with vancomycin and ceftriaxone from ___ while awaiting culture data. Her arthrocentesis gram stain and culture remains negative, however, and ___ blood cultures positive from ___ with coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which was felt to represent contamination. Due to unusual presentation of bilateral joint effusions concerning for spetic arthritis, she underwent TTE to rule out endocarditis however this showed no vegetations. She was also seen by Rheumatology consult. Multiple lab tests for Rheumatologic work-up were sent (e. g. ___, anti-dsDNA, ___, anti-CCP antibody), but none came back positive. Infectious Disease consultation recommended discontinuing antibotics, which was done on ___. She was afebrile off of antibiotics, and range of motion in both knees improved over time, as did her strength (of note, CK was WNL). She did have a very elevated CRP, however, with low ESR, in conjunction with prominent effusions of both knees, which was puzzling to all teams in terms of elucidating the etiology of her illness. Her effusions and pain limited her mobility, so she worked with Physical Therapy to improve her strength and balance. Overall, she likely had post-infectious arthritis (inciting source is unclear, but her history is notable for a likely viral-prodrome) her response was somewhat consistent with viral-mediated vs reactive arthritis. She had been afebrile for multiple days on discharge, and was not requiring analgesia. She was asked to use tylenol and NSAIDs for pain control, and follow-up with Rheumatology as an outpatient. # Rash: Patient presented with a rash consisting of erythematous, non-pruritc macules and papules spread over her anterior chest and her extensor surfaces, especially on her upper thighs. This was felt to be likely a viral exanthem given diffuse involvement without pruritus in setting of acute illness vs. drug rash in setting of exposure to cephalexin (given eosinophilia and improvement once cephalexin was stopped). This was not a typical plaque with eczematous rash as can be seen in reactive arthritis, or in sun-exposed areas as would be seen in lupus. Possibilities also included salmonella rash (light pink, over anteiror chest near shoulder), but stool culture was negative. On discharge, her rash was resolving and beginning to fade. # Thrombocytopenia: Admitted with placelet count of 118. Likely decreased production due to viral illness versus acute infection. No splenomegaly on recent imaging. Thin and thick smear negative for parasite. No spherocytes or schistocytes on smear. Resolved on discharge. # Normocytic anemia: Patient is a menstruating female, but arrived with hemoglobin of 11. 6 on admission. Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, especially given ferritin > 90. No evidence of schistocytes on smear. This was trended and stable. # Retroperitoneal Lymphadenopathy: Noted on CT at ___ done on ___. This was felt to be mild and non-specific. While it is rare, hematologic malignancy (lymphoma) can present with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Her LDH was normal, and HIV negative.",

The etiology of the infarct was thought to be a small perforating vessel off the basilar artery which may have occluded due to patient's large fluctuations in blood pressure. He had very labile blood pressure while inpatient and is currently followed as an outpatient at the ___. He was evaluated by Dr. ___ recommended midodrine 5mg BID, increased free water (___) and salt intake, head of bed upright in reverse trendelenberg with the entire bed at an angle (not just head of bed elevated) in order to optimize his blood pressure regimen and curb the large fluctuations which may help diminish his risk of hypertensive stroke in the future. Patient should only be supine when sleeping. During the day, maximize time in the upright position. Encourage ambulation, if not ambulating should be in seated position with legs dangling. If not able to walk with physical therapy he should at least stand with physical therapy. He was also continued on aspirin and simvastatin. He was monitored on telemetry which showed sinus bradycardia. A TTE was negative for PFO ___. He will follow-up with stroke neurology as an outpatient. # Left occipital horn hemorrhage: On admission CT, there was a small area of hemorrhage likely secondary to carvernous malformation. This was an incidental finding and was not thought to be related to his neurologic complaints on admission. # Parkinsonism, concern for Parkininson's Disease: Patient is followed by Dr. ___ in neurology clinic. The diagnosis of PD is not certain, and he has features of multiple system atrophy. He was continued on home pramipexole and will follow-up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient. # Othostatic hypotension: Patient has a history of very labile blood pressures followed by Dr. ___ at the autonomic center. Consulted autonomics inpatient (Dr. ___ who recommended increasing PO water (at least ___ L per day), increasing salt intake, and starting midodrine BID. The last dose of midodrine should NOT be given later than 4 ___ to decrease the risk of supine hypertension. While the patient feels that midodrine led to his stroke, a careful analysis by autonomics revealed that the benefits outweighed the risks since midodrine will decrease the BP drop while standing. We stopped fludricortisone since this medication takes a long time to take effect and may lead to supine hypertension after discharge. He will follow-up with him as an outpatient for further management. - During the ___ rehab stay, the following guidelines can help with managing autonomic dysfunction: << Supine hypertension >> -The patient should always be in the head up position (reverse Trendellenberg)) when supine (the entire bed is at an angle should not merely be sitting upright). -       If the patient experiences supine hypertension the head of the bed should be brought up or he should be sat up in a chair with his legs down - would not recommend treatment with antihypertensives if repositioning is enough to resolve his hypertension << Orthostatic hypotension >> -Use midodrine (5 mg) on a sliding scale to maintain SBP above 100 mmHg. -Ensure that midodrine dosing is not TID (i. e. 8 am, 4pm and midnight). -Last dose of midodrine should be 6 hours or more before bedtime. -Dosing should be 8am, noon or 4pm. -Do not use if patient is supine -Blood pressure typically rises throughout the day so last doses of midodrine can often be lower than morning doses. << Fluid intake >> should be at least 3 litres per day and salt intake up to 6 gram/day if no contraindications <<To prevent deconditioning >> -Patient should only be supine when sleeping. -During day maximize time in the upright position.",

The bile duct was successfully cannulated using a Rx sphincterotome preloaded with a 0. 035in guidewire. Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. Contrast injection showed a single 2. 5 cm long tight stricture at the level of the higher CHD up to the hilum, compatible with a Bismuth type II cholangiocarcinoma. There was significant post-obstructive dilation of the right and left main hepatic ducts. The CBD presented a normal caliber. A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed with the sphincterotome. There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. A cytology brush was then inserted to obtain specimen from the stricture which was sent for cytology. Subsequently, a ___ x 5cm biliary double pigtail plastic stent (Cotton ___ was successfully placed across the stricture using a preloaded OASIS stent introducer kit.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ was admitted to Urology with a RIGHT renal mass after undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events occurred please see dictated operative note for details. The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated with intravenous fluids keeping urine output at over >30cc/hour. She provided with pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient was transitioned from PCA to oral medications with the advancement to clears diet. She poorly tolerated the narcotics which caused dizziness, nausea and a general \"unwell\" feeling. She did not have emesis but did experience periorid nausea. This limited her cooperation with early mobilization and deep inspiration, incentive spirometry use. She is known to have obstructive sleep apnea and was maintained on telemetry for continuous oxygen saturation monitoring and provided CPAP and nasal canula use for overnight. She was given additional pain medications and anti-emetics and subsequently ambulated and advanced to clears with toast and crackers. She was not given Toradol because of her POD1 creatinine. At her request her narcotics were adjusted. Basic metabolic panel and complete blood count were checked daily. On POD2 her pain was moderately well controlled ranging from ___. Ms. ___ ambulated and continued to use the incentive spirometer. She was able to ambulate on room air without requirement of supplemental oxygen to keep her saturation greater than 92%. She did not feel well enough to go home and remained overnight.",

Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old G2P0 with CHTN admitted at 36 weeks 6 days with elevated blood pressures, and nausea/vomiting. Her blood pressures were quite elevated (150-170/90-110) on admission, requireing 30mg of IV Labetolol. Preeclampsia labs were normal. Her blood pressures improved and she was continued on po Labetolol. Fetal testing was reassuring. The etiology of her nausea/vomiting was unclear. She was given antiemetics. After close monitoring on labor and delivery, she was transferred to the antepartum floor for observation and a 24 hour urine collection to rule out superimposed preeclampsia. On HD#2, her blood pressures remained elevated and she developed a headache. Given her hypertension and symptoms, the decision was made to proceed with induction of labor. She progressed to an anterior lip, however, she had inadequate pain control and decelerations in the fetal heartrate. For these reasons, pitocin could not be continued and the decision was made to proceed with cesarean section. She underwent a primary LTCS on ___ (at 37 weeks) and delivered a liveborn male weighing 2670g, apgars ___. Please see operative report for details.. Postpartum, her blood pressures remained acceptable on Labetolol 300mg bid. She had no postoperative complications and was discharged home on POD#4.

No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 2. Small pleural effusions. 3. Cardiomegaly with notable biatrial chamber enlargement and evidence of prior tricuspid valve replacement. 4. Emphysema with mild basal dependent atelectasis. 5. Mildly dilated main pulmonary artery, please correlate for pulmonary Left lower extremity veins IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity veins. Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY ======== Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman s/p MVR, tricuspid annuloplasty, MAZE and left atrial appendage ablation in ___ on warfarin, s/p DCCV for atrial fibrillation in ___, hyperlipidemia, with of breast cancer s/p chemotherapy and surgery ___ and ___ arimidex, OSA intolerant of CPAP, and pulmonary artery hypertension who presented with recurrent fevers, bilateral sub-clavicular pain, and L calf pain. Despite workup, no cause was found for her fevers TEE remains to be done outpatient. She was also found to have hematuria with unremarkable sediment. #Recurrent Fevers Patient reported fevers up to ___ for 9 days preceding admission, and 1 week of similar fevers in ___ which was attributed to viral illness. There was initial concern for temporal arteritis given L temporal soreness, fevers, and elevated CRP/ESR. Rheumatology was consulted and the decision was made to defer steroids as GCA was unlikely (no visual loss, jaw claudication, progression, or other features c/w vasculitis). Malignancy was considered but thought to also be less likely given unremarkable differential, absence of LAD, and no concerning findings on admission CT chest. Does have a remote history of breast cancer, but no signs of recurrence, no lymphadenopathy. Also closely followed with breast MR/mammography. Workup for infection included blood cultures without growth, CT chest and CXR without acute process, UCx without growth, skin was unremarkable, and she had no oral lesions. The fact that she remained in sinus rhythm after recent cardioversion is also somewhat reassuring against infection. She did not experience any other localizing signs or symptoms of infection. Reassuringly, no current stigmata of endocarditis, though could be subacute presentation or localized abscess. She does meet 2 Duke minor criteria. CTA without signs of PE and ___ negative for DVT. No signs of infection on CXR and UA without signs of infection although some hematuria that's been improved. She will have a TEE outpatient, and blood cultures must be followed up. #Hematuria Hematuria on UA with sediment showing elevated RBCs, none dysmorphic, no casts. Protein/Cr ratio of 0. 3 but improved to 0. 2 on recheck. She has no signs of symptoms of cystitis, though did recently have UTI at rehab s/p antibiotics. Recommend a U/A be repeated in ___ weeks as this microscopic hematuria could be related to her recent infection. #MVP s/p mitral valve bioprosthesis (___) #Tricuspid regurgitation s/p annuloplasty (___) Currently doing well after surgery. High CRP may be explained by recent surgery. Continued warfarin with goal INR ___, Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY. #Atrial fibrillation s/p MAZE, left atrial appendage ablation (___) and s/p DCCV (___) Currently in sinus rhythm.",

You were initially admitted to the ICU because you had bleeding in the brain after falling down in your urologist's office. You were seen by Neurosurgery, who recommended conservative management and holding your Coumadin for 1 week. Your bleed was stable and you were therefore transferred to the General Medicine floor. The bleed resolved over the course of the week without additional intervention. After 1 week, your coumadin was restarted. You had pneumonia that was seen on chest X-ray and received a 7-day course of IV antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime). However you continued to have a productive cough with intermittently junky-sounding lungs, which is likely due to chronic aspiration. On ___, you were getting an ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram) when you became more short of breath and your heart began racing. Because of the sudden change in your breathing, you were transferred to the ICU for further management. However your breathing improved without specific intervention, so you returned to the General Medicine floor. For the next four days, you were more confused. However the confusion cleared on ___ and you remained stable. You had some difficulty eating normal foods without choking, especially while you were confused, so you were seen by the Speech/Swallow specialists. They evaluated how you swallow foods, and determined that you aspirate all foods, liquids and secretions. This is likely due to a combination of muscle weakness and the radiation therapy you had years ago.",

Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum C-Spine Films - IMPRESSION: No previous images. Flexion-extension views show significant narrowing and spurring predominantly involving C4-C7 and consistent with degenerative changes. No definite displacement is seen on flexion-extension views. Prevertebral soft tissues are not enlarged. R Knee Xray - IMPRESSION: No previous images. There is significant narrowing and spurring involving the medial compartment consistent with degenerative changes. Less prominent spurring without definite narrowing is seen in the lateral and patellofemoral region. Opacification in the lateral compartment is consistent with chondrocalcinosis involving the meniscus. There is a small to moderate joint effusion. L Wrist Xray - IMPRESSION: No previous images. There is significant demineralization of the visualized bony structures. Substantial degenerative changes seen in the first CMC and triscaphe joints, with heterotopic bone or calcification both anterior and posterior to the wrist. Calcification in the triangular fibrocartilage region suggests underlying chondrocalcinosis. MRCP - ___ 1. Diffusely abnormal appearance of the pancreas on diffusion weighted imaging, demonstrating marked restricted diffusion. While the pancreas itself is not enlarged, findings are concerning for autoimmune pancreatitis. Correlation with IgG 4 levels recommended. Pancreatic ductal anatomy appears conventional without divisum. 2. Mild to moderate dilatation of the intra and extrahepatic biliary ducts with the distal 2-cm of the CBD appearing tapered with abnormally thickened wall concerning for a biliary stricture, which maybe related to autoimmune pancreatitis. 3. Circumferential wall thickening, edema, and luminal narrowing of the second and third portion of the duodenum with post pyloric tube passing through it, consistent with duodenal stricture and duodenitis. 4. 1. 8 x 1. 4 cm cystic pancreatic lesion in the head/uncinate process, most compatible with side branch IPMN. 5. Mild right hydronephrosis with delayed excretion and urothelial thickening may be related to reported retroperitoneal fibrosis, with apparent abnormal right retroperitoneal soft tissue density causing narrowing of the IVC and right renal vein. 6. Edema and restricted diffusion within the right kidney may reflect inflammation from hydronephrosis, but infection is not excluded and clinical correlation with urinalysis is recommended. 7. Bilateral small pleural effusions and small amount of ascites. MRCP ___: 1. Interval progression of CBD and intrahepatic bile duct dilation caused byintrapancreatic CBD stenosis. 2. Progressive mild enhancement of extensive retroperitoneal soft tissue hasincreased, now with moderate left hydronephrosis from at least partial obstruction at the left UPJ. Mild pancreatic head edema, intrapancreatic CBD stenosis, duodenal narrowing, and severe luminal narrowing of the IVC in the right retroperitoneum are all likely from retroperitoneal inflammatory/fibrotic process. 3.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay. You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of confusion and speech troubles. You were found to have a small bleed in the left side of your brain in the temporal lobe. The etiology of the bleed is most likely due to a condition called amyloid angiopathy, which means that the blood vessels in your head are more likely to bleed. Your blood pressure was very high when you first arrived at the hospital and sometimes very high blood pressures can also cause brain blood vessels to bleed. It is very important for you to try to keep your blood pressure under control. We have started one new blood pressure medication during your stay and continued your previous medications.

Metallic devices, likely related to coil embolization seen in the medial aspect of the right kidney. There are wedge-shaped infarcts within the posterior cortex of the right renal interpolar region. 3. The left kidney is severely atrophic with severe thinning of the cortical parenchyma and  hydronephrosis with foci of calcification within the dependent portion of the lower pole calyces. Stranding of fat surrounding the left proximal ureter as well as ill-defined soft tissue stranding within the ipsilateral psoas muscle adjacent to the proximal ureter and enhancing lymph nodes in the left para-aortic region measuring up to 1 cm in short axis raise suspicion for chronic infection as an etiology for the above described findings. Comparison with any prior imaging if available is recommended to ascertain the exact cause for chronic renal atrophy on the left. 4. The liver demonstrates heterogeneous attenuation however without delayed phase imaging unable to distinguish between perfusional variant versus ischemic changes. 5. Mild splenomegaly. ___ CT chest Interval placement of a right-sided pleural drain. The right-sided pleural effusion has significantly decreased in size with decreased mediastinal shift and re-expansion of the right upper and middle lobes. However, a large right-sided effusion persists, with collapse of the right lower lobe. Brief Hospital Course: ___ hx of hep C, hx IVDA, polycystic kidney disease, FMD c/b (RAS and HTN) w/ recent admission at ___ for angioplasty of right renal artery c/b by RP bleed (embolized ___ @___) presented to ___ for right flank and abd pain.

Acute issues #RP Bleed, Right Pleural Effusion: Course began with initial admission to ___ for balloon angioplasty of right renal artery stenosis ___ fibromuscular dysplasia. Course complicated by RP bleed from wire injury(pt reported) then s/p emobolization ___. Presented to ___ ED and eventually transferred to ___ given recurrent bleed w/o active extravasation. No ___ intervention at this time. However, given effusion, she underwent pigtail catheter placement but her right lung did not fully reexpand and she was taken to the Operating Room on ___ where she underwent a right VATS decortication. She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition. She maintained stable hemodynamics and her pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA. Her chest tubes remained on suction for 48 hours and her chest xray showed almost full reexpansion of the right lung. Her oxygen saturation on room air was 97% and her port sites were healing well. Following removal of her tunes on ___ her post pull chest xray revealed almost full expansion of the right lung except for a tiny basilar space. She was converted to oral Oxycodone and Tylenol and had adequate pain control. Her chest tube sutures remain in place and will be removed at her post op visit next week and she was reminded to continue to use her incentive spirometer. Chronic issues #Hx IVDU/Substance Abuse Disorder: Per patient at bedside stated no IVDU for 6 months, however told thoracics fellow most recent use was 3 months. Patient finished 7 day course of oxycontin and oxycodone recently and denies any current use. Hep C positive.

Renal Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Mild right hydronephrosis, slightly improved from the prior CT without visualization of the right ureter. Flex Sigmoidoscopy: There was erythema, congestion, friability, and ulceration up to 35 cm, which was the extent of evaluation. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the colon and rectum. Colon BX: Mucosal biopsies: A. Rectum biopsy: Chronic active colitis with ulceration. B. Random colon:  Florid chronic active colitis with ulceration (multiple pieces). Note: No granulomas seen. Brief Hospital Course: #Colitis: Patient was transferred from OSH with ___ loose, watery bowel movements over the previous 24hrs and increasing lethargy and somulence. A CT scan on admission was notable for pan-colitis. WBC was elevated to 32 and there was strong clinical suspicion for C. diff colitis. She was started on PO vancomycin, vancomycin enemas, IV flagyl, and tigecycline and admitted to the surgical ICU. She was intubated for airway protection and transiently required levophed for systolic blood pressure in 60's. She received 10L of fluid resuscitation. Her symptoms improved with antibiotics and she was extubated within 24hrs without complication. First 2 Cdiff studies in addition to stool studies returned negative and antibiotics were narrowed. However, when PO vancomycin and IV tigeclycine were stopped her WBC count jumped and diarrhea worsened. Given clinical suspicion for infectious process, specifically cdiff, she completed a a 14 day course of PO vancomycin. After several days of hospitalization, patient developed several loose bloody bowel movements. Given negative stool studies, decision was made to perform flex sigmoidoscopy with bx showing changes suggestive of ulcerative colitis. She was started on mesalamine 1600mg PO TID with improvement of symptoms. Presentation was most likely secondary to ulcerative colitis with superimposed bacterial colitis which initially improved with antibiotic therapy. She will follow up with gastroenterology for further management of ulcerative colitis. #R IJ clot: She was found to have right arm swelling several days after right internal jugular central catheter placement. A RUE doppler showed a clot surrounding the right IJ catheter in the internal jugular vein. Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended pulling line and starting anticoagulation. Line was pulled and she was started on lovenox. Coumadin was initially started but then held in setting of GI bleed. Coumadin is being restarted at time of discharge and INR should be monitored. Once therapeutic in the ___ range for 2 days, lovenox can be discontinued. She will follow up with vascular surgery as an outpatient. She will most likely require 3 months of anticoagulation. #Multiple sclerosis: Relapsing-remitting MS with lower extremity paraplegia. Following extubation, patient had prnounced upper extremity weakness, significantly worse than baseline. Symptoms did not improve after several days. She was evaluated by neurology who were concerned for a \"man in the barrel\" infarct given hypotension and pressor requirement. An MRI and MRA head/neck showed no new abnormalities or white matter lesions. Her arm strength returned to baseline with continued treatment of colitis. She was continued on dose of baclofen this admission. #Anemia: Most likely secondary to GI bleeding and chronic disease. Hemglobin has remained stable at 8 at time of discharge and GI bleeding is decreased with mesalamine therapy. She did not require a blood transfusion. #Neurogenic Bladder: Pt has chronic indwelling foley for over ___",

Imaging: Chest X-ray ___ - New diffuse alveolar opacities throughout both lungs and perihilar haziness are findings consistent with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. Probable moderate layering pleural effusions also exist. Opacification of the bases is greater than the upper lung zones, likely de to underlying chronic interstitial lung disease seen on prior chest radiographs and CT. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due to pleural fluid. There is no pneumothorax or definite focal consolidation. IMPRESSION:  1. New moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema superimposed upon known chronic interstial lung disease. 2. Possible new bilateral pleural effusions.. CT scan ___: Known fibrotic changes, likely to reflect mild-to-moderate UIP. Newly appeared ground-glass opacities in both lungs and in diffuse distribution, suggesting either acute exacerbation or superinfection, for example with PCP.

Likely had CAP and CHF exacerbation with underlying IPF, improved with antibiotics, prednisone course and diuresis.. ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # Hypoxemia: Initial differential included CHF, pneumonia or worsening UIP/IPF. Ruled out for flu. He was started on non-rebreather and did not require intubation. He was diuresed with IV lasix, started on high dose IV steroids and covered for CAP with Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone. He continued to require 100% NRB on hospital day 2. High dose steroids were stopped for one day as unclear whether IPF flare but re-started once CT chest findings more consistent with IPF and overlying pulmonary edema. He was weaned to 5 L nasal cannula with high-dose steroids, aggressive diuresis (-4L) and antibiotics. He was stable after coming to the floor and was maintaining sats on 4L O2 nasal cannula. He completed a 5-day course of azithromycin and will have a total of 7-days of ceftriaxone/cefpodoxime. He was restarted on his home lasix dose for continued diuresis and was largely euvolemic on exam. Pulmonology evaluated patient and recommended a taper of prednisone from 60mg over 2 weeks until follow up with Dr. ___. He was started on bactrim prophylaxis while on steroids. Patient's initial hypoxemia was likely in the setting of CHF exacerbation and community acquired pneumonia causing severe symptoms given underlying structural disease due to IPF. Patient was discharged to rehab on ___ O2 and will likely need temporary home O2 after going home.. # NSTEMI: Had elevated troponin which peaked at 0. 25 with normal CK and CK-MB, no new ECG changes. TTE showed a posterior wall motion abnormality which per Dr. ___ was seen on previous studies, though the official read said this was new since ___. Patient had no chest pain or other symptoms. He was continued on ASA 81mg, simvastatin 40mg, and on atenolol and lisinopril upon discharge.",

She endorses progressive hoarseness since that time. Her symptoms were also accompanied by bilateral intermittent earaches, headaches, jaw pain and throat irritation and she was initially diagnosed with TMJ and GERD. She was seen by ENT in ___ and was found to have severe crichopharyngeal dysfunction. She underwent microlaryngoscopy vocal fold injection for vocal fold hypomobility as well as esophagoscopy, esophageal dilation and cricopharyngeal Botox injection on ___. She was evaluated by neurology with suspicion of motor neuron disease given findings of tongue deviation, dysphagia, and dysphonia and was ordered for CT, paraneoplastic panel, and brain MRI. CT of her neck revealed a 4. 6 cm mass adjacent to or arising from the left lobe of the thyroid. She underwent FNA with report of squamous cell carcinoma and was transferred to OMED for further workup and management of newly diagnosed head and neck cancer. Review of systems is notable for intermittent bilateral posterior headache, horseness, and earache. She endorses hoarseness and wheezing, though denies shortness of breath and chest pain. She cannot endorse odynophagia as she is unable to swallow any liquids or solids at this time, and is unable to swallow her secretions.

CT Neck ___ IMPRESSION:  4. 6 cm mass adjacent to or arising from the left lobe of the thyroid. Further characterization with ultrasound can be considered, but ultimately biopsy would be required for definitive diagnosis. No cervical lymphadenopathy.

Per conversation with staff at ___, the patient was noted to be leaning against a wall and more confused than usual, before sliding himself down against the wall without ever fully losing consciousness, c/w pre-syncopal or orthostatic event. Per review of his chart, he has had multiple prior admissions for similar episodes, without a definitive etiology found. The most likely etiology was felt to be due to symptomatic orthostatic hypotension in the setting of perhaps overmedication on antihypertensive medications in addition to poor PO intake and hypovolemia.

ACUTE ISSUES: ============= #Trigeminal neuroalgia: Patient with admission to ___ for shooting jaw pain in ___. She follows with neurologist ___. MD at ___ and has started gabapentin QHS. She continued to have episodic shooting pain in the left side of her face and left upper jaw. This is due to her trigeminal neuralgia. Her gabapentin was increased from 100mg QHs to 100mg TID. She was seen by neurology who recommend continued outpatient workup. in addition, neurology recommended ESR for evaluation of possible, (though unlikely) temporal arteritis without temporal artery involvement as etiology of jaw pain. ESR was pending at time of discharge. #Dementia #? Altered mental status: Patient with underlining dementia. She was AAO to person and place. In talking to her caretaker ___ this is at her baseline. I spoke to caretaker ___ ___ who reports that patient was in her otherwise state of health but had shooting pain in her jaw. She was given some tramadol that was prescribed to her for her hip surgery which made her very sleepy. This is likely the cause of her AMS as her labs are normal and she was back to her baseline according to her caretaker. #Air in the cavernous Sinus: Patient transferred from ___ to ___ given incidental CT finding of air in cavernous sinus. The most likely etiology of this is iatrogenic from IV placement, trauma or cranio facial infection. Patient has no evidence of trauma on CT of head and spine to suggest this is the etiology of air in the cavernous sinus. The patient had no leukocytosis, fever or evidence of infection of her mouth teeth or other areas of face to suggest infection.",

MRI Head:  Rads read pending on discharge. On our review showed a large (4. 5 cm x 5. 5 cm) extra-axial, parasagittal lesion causing mass effect on the left frontal lobe and left lateral ventricle. No surrounding edema, no midline shift or hydrocephalus. The lesion is diffusely contrast enhancing, and seems c/w a meningioma Brief Hospital Course: Pt. was admitted to the Neurology service after a right sided focal motor seizure at home. On neurologic exam she had very subtle UMN pattern weakness in her right leg, but otherwise a normal exam (MS was intact, no evidence of papilledema)  MRI of the head performed and showed a large parasagittal extra-axial lesion in the left frontal lobe, which seemed most c/w a meningioma (see results above). This was felt to be the likely etiology of her seizure. She had no further events in house. She was started on Keppra 500 mg BID, with instructions to titrate up over the next week to 1000 mg BID. Neurosurgery was contacted and reviewed her MRI, and agreed that meningioma was most likely. They recommended that she see Dr. ___ in clinic in the next ___ weeks to discuss resection.

He received 10 mg of decadron initially then started on 4mg q6h decadron with insulin and GI ppx with notable improvement in his headaches and symptoms, notable only for mild upgaze restriction. He received an MRI brain with and without contrast that was revealed a 4. 4 cm mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with associated hydrocephalus and crowding at the foramen magnum. On ___ patient had angiogram that showed there was nothing to embolize. Surgical resection with Dr ___ was scheduled for ___ via a suboccipital approach. The case was uncomplicated - please see Dr. ___ report for further details. Frozen consistent with spindle cell, possible meningioma. Following the procedure, he was transferred back to the Neuro ICU where he was extubated. Post-operative NCHCT significant for small amount of pneumocephalus in the resection bed, as well as stable vasogenic edema and improved hydrocephalus. No evidence of acute hemorrhage. Following the case, he had an elevation in his lactate that was treated with fluid resuscitation. He was continued on Dexamethasone 6mg Q6 which was tapered off. He was started on sq heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Post-op MRI was completed and patient was placed on non-rebreather for pneumocephalus. His lactate normalized to 1. 8. He was given Vitamin K x1 for INR 1. 5 post-op. His neuro checks were liberalized to q4h and he was called out to ___ for ongoing care. His a-line was removed. In ___ he remained neurologically and hemodynamically stable. He was evaluated by ___ who recommended discharge home with services. #Hypertension Following his procedure, the patient was maxed out on a Nicardipine gtt for goal SBP <140. He was started on 100mg Labetalol TID which was increased to 200mg on ___. His SBP goal was eventually liberalized to <150 and his Nicardipine weaned to off. He was continued on labetalol at discharge with instructions to follow up with his PCP for monitoring and medication adjustment. #Transaminitis The patient was noted to have an elevation in his liver enzymes postoperatively. This trended down over the course of his hospital stay. he was evaluated by the medicine team who felt this was in the setting of steroid use and recommended followup with his PCP.

You were admitted for evaluation of new onset atrial fibrilliation and were found to have no concerning causes of atrial fibrillation, which is a common problem usually treated with medications to control your heart rate and prevent blood clots. It will be very important to discuss this further with your Primary Care Doctor. ___ evaluated for heart abnormalities with an EKG and echocardiogram, which showed that your heart had normal electrical activity and no structural or functional abnormalities that could explain why you now have atrial fibrillation. It is likely that your atrial fibrillation is related to your lung disease. It is important to ensure that your heart rate stays within normal range when you have atrial fibrillation. Your heart rate was well controlled during your hospitalization on your home medication, atenolol 12. 5 mg. We recommend continuing this medication at home. It is also important to prevent blood clots with atrial fibrillation. Your age and blood pressure put you at increased risk for blood clots, which can lead to stroke, so we recommend that you begin anticoagulation therapy (a blood thinner) soon. We did not begin this therapy in the hospital due to concern that you may need additional procedures in the near future for your lung disease.

        "context": "colateral circulation. There was no evidence of an acute coronary occulsion. During the next few hours, the patient continued to have VT/VF which was refractory to aggressive therapy. He was shocked over 30 times on the day of admission and he received repeated cycles CPR, his electrolyte abnormaties were corrected, and anti-arrhythmic medications were administered, including lidocaine and amiodarone. The patient was hypotensive and placed on 3 pressors. The patient also had IABP and pacer wires placed in the cath lab. Eventually, the patient settled into NSR. The patient was weaned off lidocaine and given a loading dose of amiodarone. He had several days without recurrance of his VT however, on hospital day ___, he had recurrance of treatment refractory VT and despite multiple resuscitation efforts, the patient passed away on ___ at 1700. # Anoxic brain injury: It was estimated that the patient had ___ minutes without a perfusing cardiac rhythm prior to EMS arriving on the scene. He did not get any CPR during this time. The patient had signs of severe CNS injury with a bleak prognosis (decerebrate posturing babinski, dilated pupils that were minimally reactive, oculocephalics not intact) most likely anoxic brain injury. He was not felt to be a good candidate for cooling as it is a pro-arrhythmogenic and the patient presented with refractory VT. Head CT was negative for an acute intracranial bleed. The patient was noted to have tongue twitching which at first was concerning for seizures however, neurology felt it was most consistent with myoclonic jerks from anoxic brain injury. EEG showed an encephalopathy without seizure activity. Neurology was planning to reevaluate the patient's neurologic status and further discuss prognosis on hospital day 7 however, the patient passed away prior to that re-evaluation.. # Cardiogenic shock: It was felt that his cardiogenic shock was most likely secondary to an arrhythomia. He was treated with IVF, pressors and an IABP. Eventually, the patient was weaned off pressors however, he intermittently required dopamine for blood pressure support while getting propofol for sedation to syncronize the patient with the ventilator. His IABP was d/c'ed on hospital day 2. An echocardiogram showed severely depressed LVEF at 20%. The patient had LV and apical akinesis and was initiated on a heparin gtt for prophylaxis against a ventricular thrombus.. # Respiratory Failure/Ventilator Associated Pneumonia:  The patient was intubated and difficult to oxygenate initially. He was found on chest CT scan to have collapse of his Left lower lobe. He most likely had an aspiration event during his arrest. He spiked a fever and had copious repiratory secretions that were positive for bacterial pneumonia. His sputum cultures grew pseudomonas. He was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics but they were narrowed as culture data returned. The possiblitiy of PE was considered, however, CTA was not obtained because of the patient's renal function. PE was felt to be less likely as the patient's hypoxia improved with aggressive suctioning and treatment of his pneumonia. Furthermore, he was anticoagulated for his apical akinesis and therefore was receiving treatment for PE.. # Acute renal failure: The patient most likely had worsening of his chronic kidney disease from lasix and ace inhibitor prior to admission. This may have caused his hyperkalemia. After the patient's cardiac arrest, he developed ATN and required CVVH to manage his uremia.. # Shock liver and pancreatitis:  The patient had evidence of injury to mulitple organ systems including his liver and pancreas secondary to cardiogenic shock.. # Diabetes: The patient's diabetes was managed with an insulin gtt initially and then an insulin sliding scale. Medications on Admission: glyburide 5mg bid metformin 1000mg bid lipitor 80mg daily",

The patient has had no bleeding and at that point in time, the patient's bladder was not full and it was discussed with her that at the next ultrasound, she should have closer evaluation of the lower uterine segment to assess the integrity of the placenta. On ___, now at 32 weeks' gestational age, there was a placenta previa which was 3 mm from the internal os. In addition, there was a large ___ the internal os. Along the anterior margin of the placenta, there was significant thinning of the hypoechoic dome between the bladder and uterus measuring 0. 3 mm and there was concern about increased vascularity be on the bladder edge to suggest placenta accreta. Given those findings, the patient underwent MRI to look for signs of accreta. MRI performed on ___ shows the following. There was a 6 cm segment area of the lower uterine wall where there was no definite myometrium identified correlating with the site of concern on the ultrasound. The difference of this appearance is partial voluming due to slice thickness, myometrial thinning due to a C-section scar or possible placenta accreta. In addition, on MRI, there was noted to be a further 7 cm area of visualization of the myometrium more superiorly and into the left. This did not correspond with the location of the previous C-section and was much more concerning for an area of placenta accreta. The bladder appeared not to be involved in those areas. Given their concern for placenta accreta, the patient continued consultation with ___ who recommended delivery at 35 weeks' gestational age. The patient's antepartum has been fairly benign. As stated, her 18-week full fetal survey was normal. She had normal low risk early risk assessment and normal alfa fetoprotein test. She had a normal GLT, however, her hematocrit was 29. 5 at the time of her GLT and she was started on iron. The patient's labs are remarkable for blood type of A negative, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hep B surface antigen negative, hemoglobinopathy was AA, cystic fibrosis was negative, hepatitis B surface antigen was negative. Past Medical History: OB HISTORY:  Remarkable, in ___ she had a primary cesarean section due to breech presentation. That baby weighed 6 pounds 9 ounces and the C-section went well without any complications. In that pregnancy, the fetus had been diagnosed with ventriculomegaly, she had been followed closely by ___ and also had a consultation at ___ and multiple fetal brain MRIs. That child is healthy today and has no issues related to the ventriculomegaly that had resolved prior to delivery. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for being a carrier of the MTHFR gene mutation. She is heterozygous. She also has a history of mild anemia and history of C-section x 1. Of note, the patient was treated with Lovenox and baby aspirin in the first trimester due to the ___ carrier status. However, she has been off the Lovenox since the end of the first trimester and stopped the aspirin at 32 weeks' gestational age. Other remarkable antepartum issues, the patient was treated with betamethasone on ___ and ___ in preparation for early delivery. FAMILY HISTORY: positive for mother who had breast cancer at th age of ___ and a maternal grandmother who also had breast cancer. Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory Physical Exam: (on admission) GENERAL: She is a well-developed, well-nourished female. VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 112/62, fetal heart rate is 156 and reactive. NECK: Thyroid is normal in size without nodules. LYMPH: Survey is negative. HEART: Regular. LUNGS: Clear. BREASTS: Soft without any dominant masses or palpable lymph nodes. BACK AND SKIN: Without lesions. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended, without hepatosplenomegaly.

He was unit-restricted. There were no acute safety issues during this hospitalization. LEGAL: ___ PSYCHIATRIC: On admission, pt reported depressed mood with several neurovegetative symptoms consistent with MDD with an underlying dysthymic disorder. His lexapro was increased from 10 to 20mg PO daily, and his risperdal augmentation was continued at 1mg PO QAM and 2mg PO QPM. He began ECT MWF on ___. He tolerated ECT well with no significant cognitive side-effects. With ECT, his mood improved and he became more optimistic. His husband visited him several times during this admission and was very supportive. By the time of discharge, he reported a \"good\" mood, had a euthymic affect with full range, had no SI, and was future oriented and hopeful. He felt comfortable with discharge after his ___ ECT treatment on ___, to continue outpatient ECT and to follow-up with his outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. ___. Of note, as Mr. ___ reports low ___ and chronic dysthymia throughout his entire life, there appears to be a characterologic component to his presentation, especially as this episode was triggered by low ___ in the setting of his employer yelling at him. As he has a chronic condition with recurrent major depressive episodes, he will likely need to remain on maintenance antidepressant therapy indefinitely. He would likely benefit from long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy to work on his ___ and interpersonal difficulties, or cognitive behavioral therapy to work on cognitive distortions and chronic worrying.

Patient reports that he received the flu vaccine in ___ and two weeks later he developed flu like symptoms with fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. He slowly improved over 6 weeks however continued to complain of fatigue. Last week he went to the ___ clinic and labs were notable for a white count of 21K. He returned to the ___ clinic today and complained of fatigue and myalgias. A CBC showed a white count of 30K and CXR was concerning for multifocal pneumonia. In the ED, initial VS were T 99. 3, HR 108, 132/71, RR 18, 100% RA. Labs notable for a white count of 26K, Hb 9. 4, PLT 471, lactate 2. 3, Cr 1. 9 (baseline 2. 0 ), HCO3 18. UA noted to be negative The patient was given 750 mg PO levoflaxoacin, IV ceftriaxone, 500 mg MMF, and 1 L NS. CXR showed IMPRESSION: Multifocal nodular opacities in the left upper lobe can represent bronchopneumonia. Irregular opacities in the lingula have a more chronic appearance may be the sequelae of prior infection. If prior imaging is available for comparison, the images can be reviewed and an addendum dictated. Otherwise follow-up chest radiograph in 4 weeks is suggested to ensure resolution. On arrival to the floor, patient reports he feels well. He denies any pain, cough, or shortness of breath. He notes that about 1 week ago he developed URI symptoms with sore throat and cough associated with body aches noting he believes he had the flu. He denies any abdominal pain, diarrhea, or nausea vomiting. He no longer has a cough. He also denies any fever or chills. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:",

The next day he was switched to lisinopril 5 mg with a systolic blood pressure ranging from 160-180 and diastolic ranging from 100-110. On discharge, the patient was instructed to eat a 2 gram salt diet and keep a log of his blood pressure readings and bring these readings to his PCP ___. If his blood pressures were greater than 170/105, then the patient was instructed to take an extra 5 mg of lisinopril, not exceeding more than 10 mg of lisinopril a day. Of note, EKGs in the ED demonstrated ST segment depressions which were initially concerning for ischemia. The patient did not have any chest pain or shortness of breath during his hospitalization. The ST segment changes were eventually attributed to non-specific changes. The patient was ruled out for MI with cardiac biomarkers x 3 being normal and no changes on telemetry. An Echo showed LVH with normal ejection fraction. On a CXR, the patient was noted to have an enlarged aorta vs. tortuous aorta. Since his family has an incidence of vascular disease, the patient underwent a CTA of the chest and abdomen which ruled out a dissection and aneurysm. # Pulmonary nodule: The patient was noted to have a pulmonary nodule measuring 5 mm on CT. The significance of this nodule remains unclear. Per the radiology report,  \"in a patient without risk factors for malignancy, a chest CT in 12 months is recommended, with risk factors, a chest CT in six months is recommended, per ___ guidelines.

IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis. Further evaluation with an MRI or bone scan is recommended. CT abd/pelvis with contrast (___): IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive retrocrural, mesenteric, retroperitoneal and bilateral pelvic lymphadenopathy, likely representing lymphoma. 2. Left adrenal mass and mesenteric soft tissue mass, also likely lymphoma. 3. Extensive bilateral perirenal soft tissue density in keeping with lymphomatous involvement. 4. Possible biopsy targets include retroperitoneal nodes (likely preferred if complete lymphoma protocol is planned) and perirenal soft tissue. 5. Extrahepatic biliary and main pancreatic duct dilation is of uncertain etiology, but a focal obstructing lesion is not identified on this study.

Mole Biopsy ___: Hemangioma with marked hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition, extending to a peripheral specimen margin. Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ year old man with a history significant for esophageal cancer(stage III vs. IV), renal cell carcinoma (stage unknown, maybe metastatic to nearby LNs), discoid lupus, tobacco abuse and HLD who presented after a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure, found to have lesion on MRI consistent with metastatic disease. # Seizure: MRI with and without contrast revealed a single ring enhancing lesion in the left subinsular region concerning for metastatic disease. His esophageal cancer is metastatic and more advanced than his renal cancer (RCC) so this may be the source although RCC classically is more likely to metastasize to the brain. Neuro-oncology was consulted and he was seen by radiation oncology as well. He was started on Keppra with a plan for brain radiation to begin the week after discharge. He will follow up outpatient with both neuro oncology and neurology. # Back Pain: He developed back pain after his seizure that was likely a muscle strain from his fall and seizure. Given his history of cancer, plain xray was obtained that did not reveal bony lesion. # Elevated Troponin: Troponin on admission was elevated to 0. 08. In the setting of a seizure with elevated CK, his seizure is the most likely etiology. His CK index was within normal limits, reassuring against acute MI. Troponin subsequently downtrended and he had no chest pain. # Esophageal and Renal Cell Cancers: He was admitted while on cycle four of Fluorouracil - Cisplatin, dosed every 4 wks.

NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE (GC), NUCLEIC ACID PROBE, WITH AMPLIFICATION :Negative for Neisseria Gonorrhoeae by PCR.. ___ URINE CULTURE: URINE CULTURE -w/MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. Brief Hospital Course: In summary, the patient is a ___ female who presented with 1 week of worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea.. # Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea: After an extensive imaging and lab work-up the patient's abdominal pain etiology was still unclear. Work-up data with transvaginal ultrasound, abdominal & pelvic CT, vaginal swabs, and blood labs all essentially ruled out endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts w/torsion, ectopic pregnancy, GC/Chlamydia, appendicitis, kidney stones, colon pathology. Despite her benign gynecologic lab/imaging workup she had some mild tenderness on pelvic exam at her cervix. Thus, she was treated empirically for PID with Doxycycline and Cefotexan and advised that if this pain did not resolve or if she noticed any unusual odor, discharge or bleeding that she needed to follow-up with her primary care physician or see ___ gynecologist as soon as possible.. Ultimately, based on the temporality and description of watery diarrhea it was felt that Ms. ___ have been experiencing a form of viral gastroenteritis, though the prominent abdominal pain was fairly atypical. Moreover, viral gastroenteritis is frequently associated with brief elevations in lipase which was noted with Ms. ___ labs with a lipase of 99. Pancreatitis was unlikely as her symptoms appeared to quickly resolve and she was able to tolerate a regular diet well within hours of her admission. Abdominal CT also showed no radiological signs of pancreatitis. Initially, vasculitis was considered but felt to be less likely based on normal ESR and guaiac negative stool. A rarer cause such as porphyria was briefly entrtained but this is usually more chronic, relapsing abdominal pain, often with neurological symptoms which the patient lacked. Lastly, the team considered IBD as an etiology given the component of diarrhea, but this was also doubted as IBD usually presents less acutely with a more chronic course.. Upon admission she was initially placed on clear liquids but soon advanced to a regular diet which she tolerated very well with no additional diarrhea or vomiting and very minimal nausea. She was given additional IVFs for basic rehydration. For abdominal pain control she was given low doses of IV Dilaudid and then switched to PRN oral oxycodone. Compazine was given for nausea relief and Ativan was also given for dual anxiety and anti-nausea effects. Stool cultures and labs were ordered but the patient's diarrhea seemed to have abated after admission. She stated that she was not usually able to go to the bathroom in hospitals and had \"trouble\" feeling comfortable enough to have a bowel movement. Unfortunately, as sample was not collected but given the patient's desire to be discharged and her rapid clinical improvement she was not kept in the hospital simply to collect these studies. She was told, however, that if her diarrhea returned that she should return to the ED or call her primary care provider as stool studies would be an important part of the workup. At time of discharge home she was pain free and her nausea was nearly gone. She had no residual cramping or emesis either and she appeared much more alert and hydrated with moist mucous membranes and a less pallid complexion. She was asked to continue Tylenol as needed OTC for a week for any residual abdominal pain but not to exceed 3g/day.. # Anxiety - During her hospital course she was given Ativan ___ mg PO every 4 hours as needed for anxiety. She denied any suicidal or homicidal thoughts but seemed to have a sad, flat affect. She reported no hallucinations or changes in her eating or sleeping habits. She described her mood as \"steady\" but explained she still got sad at times. She explained that she felt she did not need her Klonopin anymore so she had gradually tapered herself off of it over a period of ___ weeks. She took",

Arthrocentesis performed in the ___ showed right knee with 40,000 WBC and 16,000 RBC and left knee with 32,000 WBC and 2200 RBC. Though this was not quite in range for septic arthritis, it was felt to be possible since she did reiceve one dose ceftriaxone at ___ before arhtrocentesis was performed in ___. Due to suspicious for septic arthritis, she was empirically covered with vancomycin and ceftriaxone from ___ while awaiting culture data. Her arthrocentesis gram stain and culture remains negative, however, and ___ blood cultures positive from ___ with coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which was felt to represent contamination. Due to unusual presentation of bilateral joint effusions concerning for spetic arthritis, she underwent TTE to rule out endocarditis however this showed no vegetations. She was also seen by Rheumatology consult. Multiple lab tests for Rheumatologic work-up were sent (e. g. ___, anti-dsDNA, ___, anti-CCP antibody), but none came back positive. Infectious Disease consultation recommended discontinuing antibotics, which was done on ___. She was afebrile off of antibiotics, and range of motion in both knees improved over time, as did her strength (of note, CK was WNL). She did have a very elevated CRP, however, with low ESR, in conjunction with prominent effusions of both knees, which was puzzling to all teams in terms of elucidating the etiology of her illness. Her effusions and pain limited her mobility, so she worked with Physical Therapy to improve her strength and balance. Overall, she likely had post-infectious arthritis (inciting source is unclear, but her history is notable for a likely viral-prodrome) her response was somewhat consistent with viral-mediated vs reactive arthritis. She had been afebrile for multiple days on discharge, and was not requiring analgesia. She was asked to use tylenol and NSAIDs for pain control, and follow-up with Rheumatology as an outpatient. # Rash: Patient presented with a rash consisting of erythematous, non-pruritc macules and papules spread over her anterior chest and her extensor surfaces, especially on her upper thighs. This was felt to be likely a viral exanthem given diffuse involvement without pruritus in setting of acute illness vs. drug rash in setting of exposure to cephalexin (given eosinophilia and improvement once cephalexin was stopped). This was not a typical plaque with eczematous rash as can be seen in reactive arthritis, or in sun-exposed areas as would be seen in lupus. Possibilities also included salmonella rash (light pink, over anteiror chest near shoulder), but stool culture was negative. On discharge, her rash was resolving and beginning to fade. # Thrombocytopenia: Admitted with placelet count of 118. Likely decreased production due to viral illness versus acute infection. No splenomegaly on recent imaging. Thin and thick smear negative for parasite. No spherocytes or schistocytes on smear. Resolved on discharge. # Normocytic anemia: Patient is a menstruating female, but arrived with hemoglobin of 11. 6 on admission. Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, especially given ferritin > 90. No evidence of schistocytes on smear. This was trended and stable. # Retroperitoneal Lymphadenopathy: Noted on CT at ___ done on ___. This was felt to be mild and non-specific. While it is rare, hematologic malignancy (lymphoma) can present with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Her LDH was normal, and HIV negative.",

Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: ___ M with recent tooth implant now with recurrent sinus infections who is presenting from OSH with persistent fevers & chills despite antibiotics which was found to be due to maxillary osteomyelitis. ACUTE DIAGNOSES: # Tooth Implant Infection: Pt was initially treated with IV vancomycin, ciprofloaxacin, flagyl. OFMS was consulted and recommended removing the implant the patient went to the OR on ___ for tooth implant extraction, debridement, & bone biopsy. Pt will follow up with OFMS as outpatient. # Maxillary Osteomyelitis: Treated with antibiotics as above. Given the question of positive blood cultures at OSH & presumed dental source on admission, a TTE was obtained which ruled out infective endocarditis. The patient's bone biopsy was consistent with osteomyelitis. The patient was followed by ID while hospitalized. Preliminary bone biopsy grew GPC & GNRs which were ultimately found to be micrococcus & stomatococcus, GPRs, Viridans strep. ID recommended disharging the patient on IV vancomycin & PO moxifloxacin for 6 weeks.. The patient's OSH PICC was removed (tip culture was negative) on admission a new PICC was placed. His blood cultures were remained negative. # Recurrent Maxillary Sinusitis:  Most likely thought to be due recurrent seeding from tooth implant infection and maxillary osteomyelitis. ENT was consulted and recommended obtaining CT sinuses/maxilla. The patient will follow up with ___ ENT. Pt also has hypomobility of R true vocal cord, which will also be addressed on an outpatient basis. # Diarrhea: Pt noted to have diarrhea after initiation of IV antibiotcs. C. Diff was checked & was negative. Thought to be antibiotic-associated diarrhea. # Peripheral Thrombophlebitis: Pt noted to develop indurated, erythematous area around one of his IV sites. Warm packs were applied with resolution of symptoms. CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: # HTN: Pt was continued on norvasc, HCTZ, labetalol. # HLD: Continued atorvastatin. # Anxiety: Continued xanax. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Follow Up: The patient will follow up with ENT, oral surgery, & infectious disease # Lab Draws: The patient will have weekly lab draws to monitor CBC, Chem 10, LFTs, vanco trough for 6 weeks while on vancomycin.

The etiology of the infarct was thought to be a small perforating vessel off the basilar artery which may have occluded due to patient's large fluctuations in blood pressure. He had very labile blood pressure while inpatient and is currently followed as an outpatient at the ___. He was evaluated by Dr. ___ recommended midodrine 5mg BID, increased free water (___) and salt intake, head of bed upright in reverse trendelenberg with the entire bed at an angle (not just head of bed elevated) in order to optimize his blood pressure regimen and curb the large fluctuations which may help diminish his risk of hypertensive stroke in the future. Patient should only be supine when sleeping. During the day, maximize time in the upright position. Encourage ambulation, if not ambulating should be in seated position with legs dangling. If not able to walk with physical therapy he should at least stand with physical therapy. He was also continued on aspirin and simvastatin. He was monitored on telemetry which showed sinus bradycardia. A TTE was negative for PFO ___. He will follow-up with stroke neurology as an outpatient. # Left occipital horn hemorrhage: On admission CT, there was a small area of hemorrhage likely secondary to carvernous malformation. This was an incidental finding and was not thought to be related to his neurologic complaints on admission. # Parkinsonism, concern for Parkininson's Disease: Patient is followed by Dr. ___ in neurology clinic. The diagnosis of PD is not certain, and he has features of multiple system atrophy. He was continued on home pramipexole and will follow-up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient. # Othostatic hypotension: Patient has a history of very labile blood pressures followed by Dr. ___ at the autonomic center. Consulted autonomics inpatient (Dr. ___ who recommended increasing PO water (at least ___ L per day), increasing salt intake, and starting midodrine BID. The last dose of midodrine should NOT be given later than 4 ___ to decrease the risk of supine hypertension. While the patient feels that midodrine led to his stroke, a careful analysis by autonomics revealed that the benefits outweighed the risks since midodrine will decrease the BP drop while standing. We stopped fludricortisone since this medication takes a long time to take effect and may lead to supine hypertension after discharge. He will follow-up with him as an outpatient for further management. - During the ___ rehab stay, the following guidelines can help with managing autonomic dysfunction: << Supine hypertension >> -The patient should always be in the head up position (reverse Trendellenberg)) when supine (the entire bed is at an angle should not merely be sitting upright). -       If the patient experiences supine hypertension the head of the bed should be brought up or he should be sat up in a chair with his legs down - would not recommend treatment with antihypertensives if repositioning is enough to resolve his hypertension << Orthostatic hypotension >> -Use midodrine (5 mg) on a sliding scale to maintain SBP above 100 mmHg. -Ensure that midodrine dosing is not TID (i. e. 8 am, 4pm and midnight). -Last dose of midodrine should be 6 hours or more before bedtime. -Dosing should be 8am, noon or 4pm. -Do not use if patient is supine -Blood pressure typically rises throughout the day so last doses of midodrine can often be lower than morning doses. << Fluid intake >> should be at least 3 litres per day and salt intake up to 6 gram/day if no contraindications <<To prevent deconditioning >> -Patient should only be supine when sleeping. -During day maximize time in the upright position.",

The bile duct was successfully cannulated using a Rx sphincterotome preloaded with a 0. 035in guidewire. Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. Contrast injection showed a single 2. 5 cm long tight stricture at the level of the higher CHD up to the hilum, compatible with a Bismuth type II cholangiocarcinoma. There was significant post-obstructive dilation of the right and left main hepatic ducts. The CBD presented a normal caliber. A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed with the sphincterotome. There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. A cytology brush was then inserted to obtain specimen from the stricture which was sent for cytology.
