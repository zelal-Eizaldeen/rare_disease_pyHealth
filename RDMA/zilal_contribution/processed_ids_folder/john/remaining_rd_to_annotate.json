There is a variant of IgG4 releated disease that can be associated with LAD, and in context of pt's hx of thyroiditis and protean symptoms, this may be worth exploring. Similarly, polygladular autoimmune syndromes (PAS IIIC associated with Sjogren's/UC) can be considered with her prior report of parotid dysfunction, arthralgias and UC. Will defer colonoscopy and further workup to outpatient care given extensive past workup and general stability. Continued on Budesonide 9mg daily,",
