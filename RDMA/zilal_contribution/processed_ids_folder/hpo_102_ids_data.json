Although ___ was 1698 on admission, ___ declined \nto 640 the following day, and he remained neutropenic until \n___, when Wbc was 6.4. Both vancomycin and cefepime were \ndiscontinued ___, and he remained afebrile off antibiotics for \n24 hours prior to discharge. No definitive source was isolated \nthroughout admission; BCx/UCx were negative or demonstrated no \ngrowth to date, CT torso on admission was negative for acute \ninfectious process, multiple CXRs were negative, and abdominal \nplain film showed no evidence of perforation. He remained \nhemodynamically stable throughout admission.  \n\n#Maculopapular rash: Although there was initial suspicion for \ndrug rash versus viral exanthem, diffuse erythematous \nmaculopapular rash overlying his back was felt by dermatology to \nbe miliaria and responded to conservative treatment with \nhydrocortisone cream and Sarna lotion, with significant \nimprovement over the course of admission. Serum EBV and CMV were \nnegative.\n\n#Volume overload: On admission, he endorsed 16-lb weight gain \nfrom 164 to 180 lbs over the course of his last admission in the \nsetting of IV fluid and pRBC administration, and CT torso on \nadmission demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions, with \nexam notable for sparse bilateral crackles and absence of \nperipheral edema. Following a single dose of IV Lasix on \nadmission, he returned to his dry weight within days without \ndedicated intervention. There were no signs of volume overload \nby the time of discharge. He did receive maintenance IV fluids \nin the latter half of his admission due to poor oral intake. \n\n#Mantle cell lymphoma: As noted above, he remained neutropenic \nthroughout much of admission in the setting of recent EPOCH \ntherapy. Hct remained relatively stable at ___, without \ntransfusion requirement, and although platelet count declined \nover the course of admission from 126 to 31, they had uptrended \nto 165 by the time of discharge. He remained on allopurinol \nprophylaxis without evidence of tumor lysis, as well as Bactrim \nprophylaxis and oxycodone for abdominal pain throughout \nadmission; Oxycontin was associated with nausea/vomiting, both \nof which abated following discontinuation. Close follow-up was \nscheduled in ___ clinic post-discharge. \n\n#Acute-on-chronic kidney injury: Although creatinine of 1.3 on \nadmission was consistent with recent baseline, creatinine \nuptrended over the course of admission, peaking at 1.9, \ninitially attributed to prerenal azotemia in the setting of poor \noral  intake, with FeUrea 31% on ___ in the setting of \ncreatinine of 1.9, though BUN did not increase correspondingly, \nand granular and hyaline casts were present in the urine, \nsuggesting intrinsic renal injury, possibly contrast-induced \nfollowing CT torso on admission. Urine was negative for \neosinophilia. Creatinine downtrended to 1.7 by the time of \ndischarge, and close hematology follow-up was arranged to ensure \nfurther downtrend in creatinine.\n\n#Hypertension: He remained hemodynamically stable throughout \nadmission, with occasional soft pressures to ___ systolic, \nprompting initiation of maintenance IV fluids in the setting of \npoor oral intake and holding of home hydrochlorothiazide, which \nwas resumed at discharge.\n\n#Facial lesion: Crusted facial lesion below his left lower left \nwas felt by dermatology to represent impetigo, with response to \nmupirocin cream. \n\n<<Transitional Issues:\n-Close follow-up was arranged in ___ clinic for further \ntreatment of mantle cell lymphoma and to ensure resolution of \nacute-on-chronic kidney injury.\n-Although he was offered follow-up in ___ clinic, he \nopted instead to follow up with his community dermatologist and \nwas given the contact information for ___ dermatology in the \nevent that he changed his mind.\n-Pending studies: BCx x2 (___). \n-Code status: DNR/DNI.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Patient notes that she had fever for a few days at \nthe beginning of ___.  After this resolved, a head cold began \nwhich appeared to trigger her current fevers.  Current \"flare\" \nstarted about 3 weeks ago.   About 1.5 wks ago, she was told by \nher doctor to increase dosing of colchicine rapidly to try to \nbreak fevers, so she followed instructions and took 4 pills/hr \nx4hrs, then 2pills/2hrs x 4 doses, after which she felt \nsignificantly nauseated in the middle of the night.  The next \nmorning, she tried to start taking the medication again, after \nwhich she had an episode of emesis.  She stopped taking the \nmedication initially, then began taking her usual dose 0.5 tab \nat a time and tolerated it okay, did this for a few days.

She has received her flu shot \nthis year.\nSometimes flares are associated with some abdominal pain, but \nnot currently.  Colds often appear to be trigger for flareups.  \nShe has been having nausea in the last week since taking the \nsignificantly increased dose of colchicine, as well as the \nemesis episode described above.  She has had diarrhea off an on \nfrom colchicine, but it has been persistent for the last 1.5 \nweeks as well, nonbloody.\n.\nPatient's mother states that she has had these episodes of daily \nfever since childhood, lasting for weeks to months at a time.  \nFevers have been as high as ___, often not improved with \ntylenol, sometimes requiring ice baths to bring temp down.  \nMother states that patient does not tolerate Motrin due to \nnausea, but they often alternate tylenol and aspirin in \nadulthood.

Triggered by \nURI about 3 weeks ago. Though per patient this flare has lasted \nmuch longer than previous flares and has not responded well to \ncolchicine. She has recently switched from the generic to the \nbrand name form and feels this is less effective for her. One \nand a half weeks she was advised to take large doses of \ncolchicine (hourly regimen followed by taper), this caused \nnausea/vomiting and diarrhea which has been improving. We spoke \nwith patient's outpatient rheumatologist and discussed the \npossibility that she may a non-responder to colchicine, though \nnot clear why this would occur now as she has had successful \nmanagement in the past with colchicine. She may respond better \nto the generic form. We restarted her regular dosing of 0.6mg in \nthe AM and 0.9mg in the ___. She will follow up with Dr. ___ \n___ week to discuss the possibility of initiating anakinra \ntherapy which he has begun to arrange for her as an outpatient. \nPatient did have a flu shot this year and had a negative swab 1 \nweek ago. Her URI symptoms are slowly improving. She was \nobserved in the hospital overnight and had Tmax 101.8. \nSymptomatic control was provided with IVF, Tylenol, Guaifenesin \nand Zofran.\n.\n# Cough - likely viral URI which has been improving. She does \nhave productive cough, one episode with scant streaks of blood \nlikely due to aggressive coughing. CXR was clear with no \nevidence of pneumonia. Fevers, as above, are likely due to FMF. \nShe was symptomatically controlled with Guaifenesin. Flu swab \nwas negative one week ago and she had flu vaccine this season.\n.\n# Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea - coincided with uptitration of \ncolchicine 1.5 weeks ago and has been resolving. She had 1 bout \nof loose stool during admission and no vomiting. Zofran was \ngiven prn and IVF given for dehydration (mostly due to \ninsensible losses from fever, as above). Restarted colchicine at \nmaintenance dosing as above.\n.\n# Anemia - guaiac negative in ED and no signs of active bleeding \n(other than very scant amount of blood streaked in sputum, as \nabove). She likely has anemia of chronic inflammation given low \nFe/TIBC ratio, though ferritin is normal. Her MCV and RDW are \nnormal, and though ___ may be contributing to mixed etiology it \nis unlikely that iron supplementation will be helpful in this \ncase. Colchicine can also cause myeloid suppression and anemia \nand is dose-dependent. HCT around ___ at baseline.

She had a CT scan done in the ER \nthat showed only diverticulosis, as well as a question of some \nperirectal fat stranding concerning for possible perirectal \nfistula.  Given these findings, the patient was seen by the \nColorectal Surgical Consult service in the ER, but they did not \nfeel that there was any evidence of fistula or any need for \nsurgical intervention, and recommended only that the patient be \nworked-up for her diarrhea.  After admission, the patient was \nseen by the GI service, and they felt that given the timing of \nher diarrhea, that it was most likely to be a side effect of her \nrecent chemotherapeutic agent, bendamustine, which has a very \nhigh prevalence of diarrhea as a side effect.  However, \ninfectious and inflammatory etiologies were also excluded with \nculture, as well as having the patient undergo a colonoscopy \nwith biopsy.  All the culture data has thus far returned \nnegative for infectious causes.  The colonoscopy did show \nnon-specific inflammation in the sigmoid colon, as well as an \nulcer in the sigmoid colon, which biopsy showed acute \nself-limited colitis, without any evidence of inclusion bodies \nor microorganisms, and CMV stain was negative as well.  \nFollowing the colonoscopy, the patient was given anti-diarrheal \nagents and supplemental IVF, and her symptoms improved \nsignificantly.  On discharge, her diarrhea had resolved \ncompletely.  Of note, during the admission, an ___ Oncologist \ndid see her daily, and was made aware of the likely diagnosis of \nchemotherapy-associated diarrhea.  As such, he will discuss this \nwith the patient's outpatient oncologist for the need for \npossible adjustment to the patient chemotherapy regimen.  \n.\nTransitional Issues:\n1.

You were hospitalized due you \nan elevated heart rate. You were found to be in a heart rhythm \ncalled atrial flutter. You were given medications to slow your \nheart rate and attempt to convert your heart to a normal rhythm. \nYour heart rhythm did convert to a normal rhythm, but switches \nbetween a normal rhythm and an abnormal rhythm periodically. We \nfeel you are safe for discharge at this time. \n\nWe made several changes to your medications. The medication list \nyou brought in said you were taking 2.5 mg of warfarin \n(coumadin) daily, but your outpatient doctors thought ___ were \non a higher dose. Your INR was too low on 2.5 mg daily, so we \nincreased your warfarin to your listed outpatient dose of 3.75 \nmg 3x/week and 5 mg 4x/week. \n\nWe changed your verapimil to diltiazem. You have been having \nlightheadedness, so we stopped your furosemide (Lasix) and \nterazosin for now. \n\nPlease take your medications as prescribed and follow up with \nyour cardiologist and primary care physician.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

The etiology of the infarct was thought to be a small \nperforating vessel off the basilar artery which may have \noccluded due to patient's large fluctuations in blood pressure. \nHe had very labile blood pressure while inpatient and is \ncurrently followed as an outpatient at the ___. He \nwas evaluated by Dr. ___ recommended midodrine 5mg BID, \nincreased free water (___) and salt intake, head of bed \nupright in reverse trendelenberg with the entire bed at an angle \n(not just head of bed elevated) in order to optimize his blood \npressure regimen and curb the large fluctuations which may help \ndiminish his risk of hypertensive stroke in the future. Patient \nshould only be supine when sleeping. During the day, maximize \ntime in the upright position. Encourage ambulation, if not \nambulating should be in seated position with legs dangling. If \nnot able to walk with physical therapy he should at least stand \nwith physical therapy. He was also continued on aspirin and \nsimvastatin. He was monitored on telemetry which showed sinus \nbradycardia. A TTE was negative for PFO ___. He will \nfollow-up with stroke neurology as an outpatient. \n\n# Left occipital horn hemorrhage: On admission CT, there was a \nsmall area of hemorrhage likely secondary to carvernous \nmalformation. This was an incidental finding and was not thought \nto be related to his neurologic complaints on admission.\n\n# Parkinsonism, concern for Parkininson's Disease: Patient is \nfollowed by Dr. ___ in neurology clinic. The diagnosis of PD \nis not certain, and he has features of multiple system atrophy. \nHe was continued on home pramipexole and will follow-up with Dr. \n___ as an outpatient.  \n\n# Othostatic hypotension: Patient has a history of very labile \nblood pressures followed by Dr. ___ at the autonomic center. \nConsulted autonomics inpatient (Dr. ___ who recommended \nincreasing PO water (at least ___ L per day), increasing salt \nintake, and starting midodrine BID. The last dose of midodrine \nshould NOT be given later than 4 ___ to decrease the risk of \nsupine hypertension. While the patient feels that midodrine led \nto his stroke, a careful analysis by autonomics revealed that \nthe benefits outweighed the risks since midodrine will decrease \nthe BP drop while standing. We stopped fludricortisone since \nthis medication takes a long time to take effect and may lead to \nsupine hypertension after discharge. He will follow-up with him \nas an outpatient for further management.\n\n- During the ___ rehab stay, the following guidelines can \nhelp with managing autonomic dysfunction:\n\n<< Supine hypertension >> \n-The patient should always be in the head up position (reverse \nTrendellenberg)) when supine (the entire bed is at an angle \nshould not merely be sitting upright).  \n-       If the patient experiences supine hypertension the head \nof the bed should be brought up or he should be sat up in a \nchair with his legs down - would not recommend treatment with \nantihypertensives if repositioning is enough to resolve his \nhypertension\n\n<< Orthostatic hypotension >>\n-Use midodrine (5 mg) on a sliding scale to maintain SBP above \n100 mmHg.  \n-Ensure that midodrine dosing is not TID (i.e. 8 am, 4pm and \nmidnight).  \n-Last dose of midodrine should be 6 hours or more before \nbedtime.\n-Dosing should be 8am, noon or 4pm.\n-Do not use if patient is supine\n-Blood pressure typically rises throughout the day so last \ndoses of midodrine can often be lower than morning doses.\n\n<< Fluid intake >> should be at least 3 litres per day and salt\nintake up to 6 gram/day if no contraindications\n\n<<To prevent deconditioning >>\n-Patient should only be supine when sleeping.  \n-During day maximize time in the upright position.  \n-Encourage ambulation (with support as necessary).  \n-If not ambulating should be in seated position with legs \ndangling\n-If unable to walk due to low blood pressures, physical therapy \nshould comprise moving from a seated to standing position for as \nmuch time as tolerated\n\nHospital issues: \n-HCP: ___ wife ___\n-Code: Full, confirmed\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n- see above for management of autonomic dysfunction\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

He was not felt to be a surgical candidate. He \ncontinued to have persistent fevers and leukocytosis despite \ntargeted antibiotics. The decision was made for comfort measures \nonly and he expired.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n# Sepsis with pulmonary source\nHe presented with sepsis evidenced by fever on arrival to MICU \nalong with worsening leukocytosis to 20k. He had been off \npressors since ___ at the OSH. He has multiple sources, but \nmost notable and likely being the RUL abscess and multifocal \npneumonia. OSH cultures grew aspergillus and enterbacter from \nthe abscess and serratia from sputum. He was treated with \nvoriconazole for aspergillus, meropenm for enterobacter and \nserratia, and tobramycin for presumed VAP. Vancomycin was not \ninitially continued, but he had a subsequent rising leukocytosis \nso this was added. Here, he grew pseudomonas and acitentobacter \nfrom sputum. ID was consulted for assistance with antibiotics; \nhe had multiple organisms with different sensitivity profiles, \nso antibiotics were targeted while balancing minimizing \ntoxicity. However, source control was unable to be achieved \ngiven poor surgical candidacy. A family meeting was held given \nhis poor prognosis and they and the patient reiterated that he \ndid not want to be dependent upon the ventilator/HD and he was \ntransitioned to comfort measures only and subsequently expired.\n\n# Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure\nHe underwent trach placement and remains ventilator dependent \nupon admission from OSH. Etiology multifactorial but most \nnotably due to pulmonary abscess and multifoacal PNA in setting \nof radiographic COPD. He remained in on the ventilator while in \nthe ICU on PSV. He had MV of ___ reflective are large dead \nspace ventilation. He received antibiotics as below and \nalbuterol/ipratropium inhalers. He underwent HD as below for \nassistance with volume removal.\n\n# Pulmonary abscess and VAP\nDescribed further as above. CT chest showed invasion of the \nabscess into the chest wall musculature. Thoracic surgery was \nconsulted for possible surgical management. However, he was felt \nto be too high risk of a surgical candidate and this was not \npursued.\n\n# Unstageable sacral decubitus ulcer\nUpon transfer he was found to have a large unstagable sacral \ndecubitus ulcer. Acute care surgery was consulted and performed \nbedside debridements. A flexiseal was placed for fecal \nmanagement. \n\n# Acute renal failure\nUpon transfer he had continued oliguric ARF and was \nHD-dependent. This was felt ot be pre-renal with likely \nintrinsic renal injury from septic shock leading to ATN. He \nreceived HD while hospitalized and all medications were dosed \naccordingly.\n\n# Maroon stool\nHe had a single maroon stool on transfer. He was hemodynamically \nstable.

Despite her benign gynecologic lab/imaging workup she \nhad some mild tenderness on pelvic exam at her cervix. Thus, she \nwas treated empirically for PID with Doxycycline and Cefotexan \nand advised that if this pain did not resolve or if she noticed \nany unusual odor, discharge or bleeding that she needed to \nfollow-up with her primary care physician or see ___ gynecologist \nas soon as possible. \n.\nUltimately, based on the temporality and description of watery \ndiarrhea it was felt that Ms. ___ have been \nexperiencing a form of viral gastroenteritis, though the \nprominent abdominal pain was fairly atypical. Moreover, viral \ngastroenteritis is frequently associated with brief elevations \nin lipase which was noted with Ms. ___ labs with a \nlipase of 99. Pancreatitis was unlikely as her symptoms appeared \nto quickly resolve and she was able to tolerate a regular diet \nwell within hours of her admission. Abdominal CT also showed no \nradiological signs of pancreatitis. Initially, vasculitis was \nconsidered but felt to be less likely based on normal ESR and \nguaiac negative stool. A rarer cause such as porphyria was \nbriefly entrtained but this is usually more chronic, relapsing \nabdominal pain, often with neurological symptoms which the \npatient lacked. Lastly, the team considered IBD as an etiology \ngiven the component of diarrhea, but this was also doubted as \nIBD usually presents less acutely with a more chronic course. \n.\nUpon admission she was initially placed on clear liquids but \nsoon advanced to a regular diet which she tolerated very well \nwith no additional diarrhea or vomiting and very minimal nausea. \nShe was given additional IVFs for basic rehydration. For \nabdominal pain control she was given low doses of IV Dilaudid \nand then switched to PRN oral oxycodone. Compazine was given for \nnausea relief and Ativan was also given for dual anxiety and \nanti-nausea effects. Stool cultures and labs were ordered but \nthe patient's diarrhea seemed to have abated after admission. \nShe stated that she was not usually able to go to the bathroom \nin hospitals and had \"trouble\" feeling comfortable enough to \nhave a bowel movement. Unfortunately, as sample was not \ncollected but given the patient's desire to be discharged and \nher rapid clinical improvement she was not kept in the hospital \nsimply to collect these studies. She was told, however, that if \nher diarrhea returned that she should return to the ED or call \nher primary care provider as stool studies would be an important \npart of the workup. At time of discharge home she was pain free \nand her nausea was nearly gone. She had no residual cramping or \nemesis either and she appeared much more alert and hydrated with \nmoist mucous membranes and a less pallid complexion. She was \nasked to continue Tylenol as needed OTC for a week for any \nresidual abdominal pain but not to exceed 3g/day.      \n.\n# Anxiety - During her hospital course she was given Ativan ___ \nmg PO every 4 hours as needed for anxiety. She denied any \nsuicidal or homicidal thoughts but seemed to have a sad, flat \naffect. She reported no hallucinations or changes in her eating \nor sleeping habits. She described her mood as \"steady\" but \nexplained she still got sad at times. She explained that she \nfelt she did not need her Klonopin anymore so she had gradually \ntapered herself off of it over a period of ___ weeks. She took \ntwo tablets 3 days prior to admission. In the past she had taken \nup to 300mg daily of Effexor XR but she reported that she \nstopped taking this several months ago. She was started on 20mg \nCelexa for both anxiety and depression. Compliance was addressed \nand encouraged and she was advised to discuss possible dose \nadjustments at her upcoming primary care appointment and/or with \nher psychiatrist Dr. ___. She was also warned that abrupt \ndiscontinuation of this medication may be harmful. For \nadditional anxiety control she was asked to restart her prior \nregimen of ___ Klonopin tablets as needed up to three times \ndaily. The patient's psychiatrist was emailed regarding her \ncondition and the patient was asked to call Dr. ___ to schedule \nan appointment as soon as possible.     \n.  \n# Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: Daily electrolytes were \nmonitored and repleted as needed and she was placed on a clear \nliquid diet and then soon advanced to a regular diet which she \ntolerated very well. Diarrhea and nausea resolved by time of \ndischarge.  \n.\n#Prophylaxis: Ms. ___ was given subcutaneous Heparin for \nDVT prophylaxis and no bowel regimen was given in the setting of \nher recent diarrhea. \n.\nThe patient was maintained as a full code status for the \nentirety of her hospital stay and communication occurred \ndirectly with the patient on a daily basis. \n \n.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nKlonopin ___ mg TID (recently self-tapered and not currently \ntaking)  \n.  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

At that time, his only \ncomplaints were fevers to 102 and very minimal cough. He was \ntreated with abx as an inpatient and then discharged with a \nscript of an unknown antibiotic (?azithromycin) but never filled \nit. His respiratory symptoms and fevers resolved but he \ndeveloped dysuria two days ago. He describes it as a burning \nsensation when he urinates but denies any nocturia, polyuria, or \nfevers.

No pleural effusions.  No \npneumonia, no pulmonary edema. Slight rightward deviation of \nthe trachea, caused by an elongated aortic arch. \n\nPharmacologic stress echo ___\nConclusions  \nThe patient received intravenous dobutamine beginning at 15 \nmcg/kg/min, increasing to 30mcg/kg/min and 45 mcg/kg/min in 3 \nminute stages plus 0.25 mg atropine. The test was stopped \nbecause the target heart rate was achieved. There were no \ndiagnostic ECG changes with exercise (see exercise report for \ndetails). There were normal blood pressure and heart rate \nresponses to stress. \n.\nResting images were acquired at a heart rate of 75 bpm and a \nblood pressure of 134/70 mmHg. These demonstrated normal \nregional and global left ventricular systolic function. At \nmid-dose dobutamine [30 mcg/kg/min; heart rate 93 bpm, blood \npressure 158/70 mmHg), there was appropriate augmentation of all \nleft ventricular segments. At peak dobutamine stress [45 \nmcg/kg/min and 0.25 mg atropine; heart rate 127 bpm, blood \npressure 164/70 mmHg), there appears to be new regional \ndysfunction in the distal lateral wall (see clip 27 compared to \nbaseline clip 19 and early recovery clip 31). This may be due to \nimage quality/off axis imaging.\n\nIMPRESSION: No diagnostic ECG changes with possible 2D \nechocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to \npharmacologic stress. \nSuboptimal study - sub-optimal image quality during \npost-exercise acquisitions.\n\nLABS ON DISCHARGE:\n==========================\n___ 05:50AM BLOOD WBC-5.3 RBC-5.25 Hgb-11.7* Hct-38.3* \nMCV-73* MCH-22.2* MCHC-30.4* RDW-16.6* Plt ___\n___ 05:50AM BLOOD Plt ___\n___ 05:50AM BLOOD Glucose-100 UreaN-21* Creat-1.0 Na-138 \nK-3.8 Cl-98 HCO3-31 AnGap-13\n___ 05:50AM BLOOD TotProt-6.3* Calcium-8.8 Phos-3.6 Mg-2.2 \nIron-56\n___ 05:50AM BLOOD calTIBC-254* Ferritn-382 TRF-195*\n___ 05:50AM BLOOD CRP-74.4*\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with CAD s/p multivessel CABG, CHF, sick sinus syndrome s/p \npacemaker, transferred from ___ for further workup of \nfever and new onset rash and respiratory distress, afebrile and \nclinically well since his transfer from ___. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=====================\n# Fever -  The patient initially presented with fevers to 104.0, \ndyspnea and cyanosis at home. He was treated for CHF \nexacerbation and pneumonia with initial improvement in his sxs \ndespite unimpressive CXR. His urine and blood cultures returned \nnegative. His fever is not consistent with fever of unknown \norigin as that would require a duration of 3 weeks with no known \nsource. The patient was afebrile during the hospitalization and \nantibiotics were discontinued on ___ without return of fever. \nRepeat chest x-ray showed no signs of pneumonia, pleural \neffusion or pulmonary edema. Urine culture showed no growth. \nPatient's presentation was most consistent with a viral lower \nrespiratory infection triggering afib with RVR and a CHF \nexacerbation, which had been controlled prior to transfer. \nHowever, given the association with a new onset eruptive rash, \nimmune or vascular etiologies were considered, and biopsies were \ntaken by dermatology as below. \n\n# Rash - Patient was transferred from ___ because of concern \nthat his skin rash was consistent with a vasculitis or \nautoimmune disorder. The rash consists of red papules ~0.5mm in \ndiameter and looks to be consistent with cherry hemangiomas, \nwhich dermatology consult agredd with. However, the reason for a \nsudden eruption was unclear. Per dermatology, this could be seen \nwith medications or multiple myeloma. Patient recently took a \ncourse of bactrim for UTI. Skin biopsies were taken, and \npathology confirmed cherry hemangiomas. SPEP and UPEP were \npending on discharge, and patient's PCP ___ with \nresults.\n\n# Left renal thickening - There was concern by ___ Urology, \nDr. ___ renal stone given fever and abnormal findings \non CT abd/pelvis, which was done with contrast. He requested a \nrepeat CT w/o to look for stones and urine cytology. CT w/o \ncontrast confirmed lack of stone. He has ___ appointment \nwith urology to ___ the left renal thickening.\n\n# CAD - Patient had 6 vessel CABG many years ago (unclear how \nmany). He did not have any chest pain during the admission. The \npatient had nonspecific ST changes as well as TWI on EKG which \nwere thought to be due to memory T waves, however given his \nhistory he underwent a pharmacologic stress echo.  This \ndemonstrated no diagnostic ECG changes but with possible 2D \nechocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to \npharmacologic stress. On further discussion with the reading \ncardiologist, given his presentation this was thought to be \nunlikely due to CAD/ischemia, may be due to image quality/off \naxis imaging.  His medical regimen was therefore optimized, afib \ntreated as below and cardiology f/u scheduled.  Home aspirin, \nmetoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate were continued during \nadmission. \n\n# Afib: New onset since arrival at ___.  EKG done on the \nfloor was consistent with coarse a.fib, and was reviewed with \ncardiology given new TWI, thought to be due to memory t waves in \nthe setting of recent pacing. The patient now has a CHADS2 score \nof 3 based on CHF, HTN and A.fib as well as possible new onset \ndiabetes (see issue of HBA1c below). He was started on warfarin \nprior to discharge and will ___ with his PCP for \nmanagement.\n\n# Elevated HBA1c\nPatient had an elevated HBA1c of 6.2 which puts him in the range \nof prediabetes. \n\n# Hypothyroidism\nThe patient had an elevated TSH of 6.7 with a slightly decreased \nT4 of 0.7. This is consistent with primary hypothyroidism due to \na dysfunction of the thyroid gland. Sick euthyroid syndrome \npresents with central hypothyroidism with decrease in both TSH \nand T4 so his lab abnormalities are likely due to another cause. \nNotably, furosemide is known to reduce T4 binding to TBG as \nfound in (J Clin Endocrinol Metab. ___. He \nis not currently showing any signs of hypothyroidism so this was \nnoted in transitional issues to be followed as an outpatient. \n\n# Elevated CPK to 1200 at OSH. Within normal range at 289 on \n___ at ___. Elevation was attributed to rigors, which is \nconsistent with the normalization on repeat level. Simvastatin \n80mg was changed to atorvastatin 40mg as simvastatin doses above \n20mg have been shown to have increased risk of myalgias when \ntaken with amlodipine. \n\n# CHF - Transthoracic echo showed EF 70%, LV hypertrophy and \nmoderate pulmonary hypertension. BNP was elevated to 3000 at \n___. He was given furosemide for diuresis at ___ for \ntreatment of CHF exacerbation and his symptoms have since \nimproved. He had no JVD or peripheral edema on exam, and his \nhome furosemide 60mg daily was continued.\n\n# Anemia\nThe patient has been anemic since arrival with Hb from \n10.9-11.7. Ferritin was normal. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n=======================\n# HTN - Continued amlodipine  \n# BPH - Continued doxazosin  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=========================\n- Switched patient from simvastatin 80mg to atorvastatin 40mg as \nsimvastatin doses above 20mg has been shown to have increased \nrisk of myalgias when taken with amlodipine. \n- Patient's CT scan showed urothelial thickening of the left \nrenal pelvis without evidence of hydronephrosis. Malignancy \ncannot be excluded. Patient has ___ with urology, urine \ncytology pending on discharge. Will need possible cystoscopy, \nrepeat CT scan. BI urology ___.  \n- Patient has dermatology ___ on ___ for suture \nremoval and biopsy results. \n- SPEP and UPEP are pending on discharge. \n- Mild transaminitis during this admission. Please f/u on \n___. \n- Pt A1c was 6.2 this admission. Please continue to trend. \n- The patient has been anemic since arrival with Hb from \n10.9-11.7. However, ferritin was 384. \n- TSH 6.7 with free T4 0.7. Please repeat TFTs and consider \nstarting levothyroxine if persistent. \n- Warfarin was started for new onset afib after discussing \nanticoagulation options with PCP/pt. Per pharmacy \nrecommendations, started at 2.5mg qday and should check in 5 \ndays.\n-? reversible ischemia on ECHO but given presentation with Afib \nand possible infectious process, cardiology did not feel that he \nneed intervention.

There is diffuse intrahepatic biliary dilatation with abrupt \ncut off at the level of the origin of the common hepatic duct \nsuggesting a Klatskin tumor. A mass is seen in segment IVB of \nthe liver which may be a primary neoplasm or metastasis. The \nmass is difficult to separate from the adjacent gallbladder wall \nand adenopathy in the porta hepatis. Recommend abdominal MRI \nwith and without contrast and MRCP for further evaluation.\n2. Abnormal appearance of the gallbladder with suggestion of \nsubmucosal edema with central sludge. This will also be better \nvisualized on MRI.\n3. Proximal left ureteral obstruction without evidence of stone \nwith delayed function, worrisome for a subtle mass or primary \nneoplasm in the proximal ureter. This may also be better \nvisualized on the abdominal MRI.\n4. 15 mm submucosal right-sided distal esophageal mass \ncorresponds to the\nfindings reported on recent endoscopy.\n\nMR ___\nIMPRESSION:\n1. There is an infiltrative process in segment IVB of the liver \nwith a 23 mm posterior mass as well as an additional 10 mm \nnodule anteriorly with delayed enhancement concerning for a \ncholangiocarcinoma. The mass extends into the porta hepatis \nwhere it obstructs the biliary tree. There is metastatic \nadenopathy in the upper abdomen, diffuse moderate intrahepatic \nbiliary dilatation with a normal caliber pancreatic duct and \ncommon bile duct, and a sludge-filled gallbladder with \nsubmucosal edema, all secondary to the liver mass. Recommend GI \nconsultation for consideration of ERCP versus transhepatic \ncholangiogram. Image guided liver biopsy should also be strongly \nconsidered.\n2. There is an abrupt transition in caliber of the proximal left \nureter with wall thickening which could be neoplastic, either \nprimary or secondary, or postinflammatory. Recommend urology \nconsultation.\n3. 15 mm distal esophageal mass is confirmed.\n\nERCP ___:\nImpression:\nThe scout film was normal.\nThe major papilla appeared normal.\nThe bile duct was successfully cannulated using a Rx \nsphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035in guidewire. Contrast was \ninjected and there was brisk flow through the ducts. Contrast \nextended to the entire biliary tree.\nContrast injection showed a single 2.5 cm long tight stricture \nat the level of the higher CHD up to the hilum, compatible with \na Bismuth type II cholangiocarcinoma. There was significant \npost-obstructive dilation of the right and left main hepatic \nducts. The CBD presented a normal caliber.\nA biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed with the \nsphincterotome. There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding.\nA cytology brush was then inserted to obtain specimen from the \nstricture which was sent for cytology.\nSubsequently, a ___ x 5cm biliary double pigtail plastic stent \n(Cotton ___ was successfully placed across the stricture \nusing a preloaded OASIS stent introducer kit.\nExcellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and \nfluoroscopically. I supervised the acquisition and \ninterpretation of the fluoroscopic images. The quality of the \nfluoroscopic images was good. \n \nMR-Urogram:\n1. Mild-to-moderate left hydronephrosis and proximal left \nhydroureter with\nureteral kinking and abrupt transition in its midportion at the \nlevel of L3.\nAlthough findings are in a typical location of a UPJ \nobstruction, there is\nassociated urothelial hyperenhancement and although no discrete \nlesion is seen\na ureteroscopy is recommended to exclude an underlying lesion.\n2. Delayed contrast excretion from the left kidney.\n3. Intrahepatic biliary obstruction to the level of the common \nhepatic duct\nwith a partially imaged ill-defined mass at the level of the \nporta hepatis,\nbetter evaluated on dedicated MRCP from Atrius.\n4. Suspicious porta hepatic/celiac chain lymphadenopathy.\n5. Known esophageal mass is not imaged on this examination.\n6. Unchanged appearance of the gallbladder which is mildly \ndistended with wall edema.\n \nPATHOLOGY:\n- Cytology from brushings pending on discharge\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old woman with a history of anal cancer s/p \nchemoradiation (___) who is admitted with pruritis and jaundice \nwith imaging suggestive of biliary obstruction, liver mass, and \nuretal mass.\n  \n# Jaundice\n# Biliary obstruction:\n# Presumed metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: \nShe presented with acute biliary obstruction and underwent an \nERCP which found an area of narrowing concerning for \ncholangiocardinoma, stent was placed and brushings obtained, \ncytology remained pending at time of discharge. Based on imaging \nthere was concern for metastatic spread to liver. ___ \nOncology was consulted and case was presented at tumor board \nwhich resulted in likely metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and no \nrole for either surgical or radiation therapy, will require \nsystemic chemo. Also no need for additional biopsies. Her LFTs \nand TBili downtrended during admission following ERCP. CA ___ \nwas found to be elevated. HIV Ab negative. The plan at time of \ndischarge was for ___ Onc to follow up cytology results and \nto see her as an outpatient to decide on treatment course. She \nwill also be referred to ___ for a clinical trial given \nmetastases. \n       \n# Ureteral wall thickening: \nPatient without hydronephrosis on initial imaging and urinating \n___ without acute renal failure. UA without blood. In \ndiscussion with hematology, there was concern that this may \nrepresent an additional primary tumor site since lesion was \noutside radiation field. Urology was consulted who recommended \nMR-Urogram. MR-Urogram showed mild hydronephreosis and a small \narea which was non-definitive for a tumor and recommend \noutpatient Ureteroscopy. This was communicated both to patient \nand Oncologist, both of whom are aware of need for Ureteroscopy. \nBased on new diagnosis of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, plan to \nhold off on investigating this lesion\nfor now.  \n      \n# Esophageal mass: EGD done on ___ at ___ with submucoal \ndistal esophageal nodule, not biopsied at the time. Unable to be \nbiopsied during ERCP. ___ need repeat EGD with EUS and biopsy at \na future date.

You were admitted to the abdominal pain, which \nwe found was due to an infection in your gallbladder (a \ncondition called cholecystitis).  While you were here, the \nresults of a diagnostic test you had on your last admission \nrevealed that the source of the cancer in your liver was a \nmesastasis (or spread) from the anal cancer you had previously.  \nSeveral teams of physicians evaluated you, including \noncologists, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, \nand surgeons.  The risk of surgery was felt to be too high at \nthis time, so a temporary tube was placed in your gallbladder to \ndrain the infected fluid.

For details, please see separately \ndictated note by Dr. ___ Dr. ___. The patient \ntolerated procedure without complications.  She was taken to the \nICU for first 24 hours for monitoring of neurological status, \nwhich remained stable, and was thereafter transfered to the \nfloor.  The details of her hospital course are reviewed below by \n___: \n \nNeuro: Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the ICU for \ncloser monitoring of her vital signs and neurological function, \ngiven the proximity of the surgery to the carotid artery. Her \nexam remained stable and she was transfered to the floor on POD \n1. Regarding her cranial nerve exam, post-operatively, she was \nnoted to have some weakness with tongue movement to the left \n(left CN XII) as well as paralysis of the left true vocal cord, \ndeceased peristalysis of left pharyngeal wall with some pooling \nof secretions on that side which was anticipated given intra-op \nresection of the left vagus nerve. As a result of anticipated \ndifficulty with POs, an NGT was placed on POD #1; on POD #4, \nafter evaluation by speech and swallow, a diet was initiated \nwith compensatory maneuvers (see below) for her nerve deficits.  \nPain was initially controlled with IV dilaudid while she was \nNPO. After NGT placement on POD1, she was transitioned to pain \nmedications through the NGT with good effect. \n\nCV: She had elevated BP to SBP 160-180 in the initial \npost-operative days which were attributed to pain and \nhemodynamic re-adjustment after carotid body removal.  Her blood \npressure normalized by POD #5.  She was instructed to follow-up \nwith PCP as an outpatient to have her blood pressure monitored.\n \nResp: The patient had oxygen saturations >95% throughout \nadmission.

An NGT \nwas placed on POD #1 and she was started on continuous tube feed \ndiet with Replete with fiber @ 60 cc/hr.  Nutrition was \nconsulted who agreed with plan.  Speech/swallow was consulted on \nPOD #4 and she underwent a video floroscopic examination to \nevaluate pharyngeal swallowing mechanism and aspiration. She had \ndecrease mobility of the left side of her pharynx with some \npooling on the left side, but this was compensated for by head \nturn to left, chin tuck and hand pressure to left neck.  She was \ncleared for a pureed, moist thin food with thin liquid diet, \nwhich she tolerated.  She was instructed on signs/symptoms to \nlook for in terms of aspiration.  She was discharged with a plan \nto continue on cycled tube feeds nocturnally with replete with \nfiber @ 80 cc/hr x 14 hrs and and diet as above with oral \nnutrition supplements as tolerated.

Moderate enlargement of the cardiac \nsilhouette is similar to prior. The thoracic aorta is tortuous \nand diffusely calcified. There is mild pulmonary vascular \nindistinctness, suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular \ncongestion. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or \npneumothorax is identified. Marked wedge deformity of a low \nthoracic lumbar vertebral body is unchanged with focal kyphosis. \n\n  \nIMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. \n\nECHO ___: The left atrial volume is severely increased. Left \nventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. \nRegional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left \nventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue \nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling \npressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThe aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The \nascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nare mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the \naortic valve. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The \nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac \noutput. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen \non the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to \nsuboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There \nis a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Diastolic \ndysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Severe \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Biatrial dilatation. \nDilated thoracic aorta.\n\n___ CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast:\nIMPRESSION: \n1.

On the right, the cranial \naspect of the internal jugular vein is appropriately \ncompressible. However, the more caudal aspect of this vessel is \ndistended with isoechoic intraluminal contents and is \nnoncompressible and shows absent flow on color Doppler analysis, \nconsistent with deep venous thrombosis.  Wall-to-wall flow is \npresent in the right subclavian vein. The axillary, brachial, \nbasilic, and cephalic veins on the right are all appropriately \ncompressible and show wall-to-wall flow on color analysis. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Deep venous thrombosis involving the caudal aspect \nof the right internal jugular vein. \n\nMICRO:\n\n___ 3:55 pm BLOOD CULTURE\n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Blood Culture, Routine (Final ___: \n      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.

Catheter tip was also positive for staph at that time. \nThe line was pulled and a new line was not placed. The patient \nwas initially treated with Vancomycin during hemodialysis; this \nwas switched to Cefazolin during hemodialysis once sensitivities \nreturned. The patient will remain on a six week course of \nCefazolin, to treat bacteremia and to cover endocarditis (see \nbelow.) Importantly, she will need weekly surveillance labs to \nbe drawn at hemodialysis and faxed to infectious disease while \nshe is on Cefazolin.\n.\nOf note, the patient remained hemodynamically stable and \nnon-septic throughout her stay. She was afebrile with the \nexception of one low grade fever to 100.6 the night before \ndischarge. She did have a soft murmur on exam but never \ndeveloped stigmata of endocarditis on exam.\n.\nThe ID team was consulted and followed. They recommended \nsurveillance imaging. A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast was \nnegative for abscess or other evidence of infection. A TTE was \nperformed (see anatomical details below) and did not show \nvegetations. In consultation with ID and Renal we decided not to \npursue a TEE in the patient given the fact that she continued to \nhave negative blood cultures after the line was drawn and that \nthe TEE itself has risks of aspiration in an ___ year old woman. \nBoth the ID and renal teams were in agreement with this plan. \n.\nFinally, an upper extremity vascular U/S did show thrombus in \nthe inferior aspect of the right IJ, where her hemodialysis line \nhad previously been placed. This was discussed with the ___ \nteam, who felt strongly that the patient should not be \nanti-coagulated given the low risk of PE with RIJ thrombus and \nalso the fact that they suspect that they clot has been there \nfor a long time surrounding her HD line. In addition, they felt \nthat the risks of anti-coagulation outweighed the benefits; \nclearly there is a general risk of bleeding with \nanti-coagulation, but specifically there is a risk of \ninfiltration of the AV fistula which is already tenuous. After \nextensive discussion with Renal, and with the family, the \ndecision was made not to anti-coagulate. However, the patient \nwas set up with Heme-Onc followup for followup of this clot. The \npatient should get imaging in a few months to look for \nresolution- this should be followed by Heme-Onc and the \npatient's PCP.  \n.  \n# ESRD on HD: The patient was continued on HD here. After her HD \nline was pulled, her AV fistula was used. Dr. ___ the \nrenal team were very involved in her course here and will be \nfollowing her as an outpatient. She will be dosed with Cefazolin \nat HD and have weekly labs drawn there. She will continued on a \n___ schedule. Of note, her Phos was low \nthroughout her hospitalization. Sevalamer was held on discharge \nand should be restarted by her Renal team when appropriate.\n. \n# Structural Heart Disease: The patient has no report of \nstructural heart disease in our records. However, Echo here \nrevealed severe MR, hyperdynamic EF, pulmonary hypertension and \nPCWP 18 on ECHO with no previous echo for comparison. Her lungs \nclear on exam and so she did not appear to be in heart failure. \nHowever, a followup appointment was made with cardiology for \nmaximization of her medication regimen in the setting of these \nnew findings and to establish followup. \n.\n# Leukopenia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient presented with \nleukopenia and thrombocytopenia. In looking back in labs in our \nsystem from ___ and recent labs faxed to us from ___ clinic, it \nappears that these values have been trending down over time. \nEtiology is unknown to us; her PCP was emailed about this, but \nwe have not heard back as to whether she has already had a \nworkup for these issues. Of note, these values improved over her \ncourse and likely were partially related to infection. This \nshould be followed up by her PCP. \n.\n# Anemia: Patient presented with anemia, that was stable \nthoughout her admission. It is unclear as to whether she is or \nshould be on epogen at baseline. B12, folate normal. Renal and \nher PCP should follow up this issue. \n. \n# HTN: Continued on her home meds.  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMetoprolol Succinate 50 mg daily\nSevelamer 800 mg TID with meals\nB complex-Vitamin C-Folic Acid 1 mg daily\nColace 100 mg BID\nSenna 8.6 mg BID\nBisacodyl 5 mg QD\nValsartan\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

We repeated cultures of your blood here which \nconfirmed this. We treated you with Vancomycin and removed the \nhemodialysis catheter, which we think caused this infection.\n.\nFor hemodialysis in the coming weeks, the renal doctors ___ use \nyour AV fistula instead of placing a new line. They will treat \nyou with Cefazolin, another antibiotic, during hemodialysis to \ntreat your infection. You will require 6 weeks of treatment with \nthis antibiotics.\n.\nWhile you were here, we did a few imaging studies to look for \ninfections in other areas of your body. The CT scan of your \nabdomen showed no infection. We did an echo of your heart that \nalso showed no infection. This echo however did show some \ndysfunction which will need to be followed up by a cardiologist. \nFinally, the neck U/S did show a clot. There is a low risk of \ncomplications of clot, such as the clot moving to your lungs, \nbut in extensive discussion with Dr. ___ think that the \nrisks outweigh the benefits of treatment with blood thinners. \nHowever, we would like you to follow in ___ \nclinic (see appointments below.)\n.\nPlease make the following changes to your medications:\n- Cefazolin: This is an antibiotic that will be given to you \nduring hemodialysis.\n- STOP your sevalamer TEMPORARILY, given that your Phos levels \nhave been very low. Your renal team can decide when to restart \nthis.\n.\nPlease take all of your other medications like you were prior to \nadmission.\nPlease go to all of the followup appointments below.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n\n \nName:  ___                     ___ No:   ___\n \nAdmission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___\n \nDate of Birth:  ___             Sex:   F\n \nService: MEDICINE\n \nAllergies: \nCiprofloxacin Hcl\n \nAttending: ___.\n \nChief Complaint:\nFatigue\n \nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n___ Line Placement ___\n \nHistory of Present Illness:\nAn ___ year old ___ speaking female with PMH ESRD on \ndialysis, CHF LVEF 55% and likely myelodysplastic syndrome \npresented to ___ clinic to day for a blood transfusion \nhowever when she arrived, she was noted to have low grade \ntemperature to 100.2, by report she also complained of chest \npain and was hypoxic to 93% on room air.

There \nis blood extending into the  left subarachnoid and subdural \nspaces with mass effect on the adjacent sulci.  \nThere is 8 mm rightward shift normally midline structures.  \nSubdural blood \ntracks along the falx and tentorium.  A small amount of \nhyperdense material is seen layering in the atrium of the left \nlateral ventricle; there is effacement of the left lateral \nventricle and mild trapping of the right lateral ventricle. \n  \nLeft scleral calcification is noted.  Small subgaleal hematoma \nseen along the right parietal calvarium with mild overlying \nscalp soft tissue swelling.  The visualized portions of the \nparanasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear grossly \nwell-aerated.  Vascular calcifications are noted.  No acute bony \nabnormality is detected.   \n  \nIMPRESSION: \nLarge parenchymal hemorrhage in the left parietal and temporal \nlobes with \nextension into the subarachnoid and subdural spaces and \nintraventricular \nextent, and with severe associated mass effect.  \n\nNOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above \ninterpretation, and \nnote that some images (series 2, images ___ suggest that \nthere may be an epidural component to the hemorrhage, in \naddition to the subdural described above. \n  \n\nShoulder radiograph ___\nFINDINGS:  No previous studies available for direct comparison. \nThere is generalized demineralization.  There are no signs for \nacute fractures or dislocations.  There are degenerative changes \nof the AC and of the glenohumeral joints.  There is a prominent \nsubacromial spur which can predispose to rotator cuff \nimpingement. \n\nCXR ___\nFINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is \nevidence of newly appeared bilateral small pleural effusions as \nwell as decrease in lung volumes and an increase in vascular \ndiameters.  Altogether, these findings are strongly suggestive \nof moderate pulmonary edema.  The pre-existing perihilar  haze \nand the increase in diameter of the hilar vascular structures is \nconstant. \n  \nCT CHEST ___\nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than \nleft, with diffuse ground-glass opacity, which is non-specific \nbut most likely represents edema, less likely infection.  \n  \n2. Left upper lobe consolidation, concerning for infection, \ndifficult to \nevaluate the perihilar component in the absence of intravenous \ncontrast.  \nShort interval followup CT after treatment is recommended to \nensure resolution and exclude malignancy. \n  \n3. Increased bibasilar subpleural cystic spaces compared to \n___. \n  \nCXR ___\nFINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the \nparenchymal opacities that pre-existed bilaterally have slightly \nincreased in extent and severity.  \nThe combination of pneumonia and pulmonary edema is likely.  \nThere is \nunchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  Status post fall, no safe \nevidence for rib fractures or other bony lesions.  The presence \nof a moderate right pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given \nblunting of the right costophrenic sinus. \n\nCXR ___\n1.  New Dobbhoff tube is curled in upper mediastinum and neck \nand has to be repositioned. \n2.  The remainder of the exam including the bilateral lung \nopacities are \nunchanged.   \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs ___ is an ___ ___ speaking female with ___ ESRD on \ndialysis, CHF LVEF 55% and myelodysplastic syndrome presents \nfrom dialysis with fever to 103 and cough. She was neutropenic \nwith an ANC of less than 650 and her platelets were 24. She was \nadmitted and placed on vancomycin and cefepime to cover HCAP.  \nWhile on the floor the patient had an unwitnessed mechanical \nfall in which she struck her right shoulder. She was seen and \nthrough a translater she denied head strike, LOC, N/V, change in \nvision or headache. She reported that she ___ her right \nshoulder. Her exam was not notable other than pain in the right \nshoulder. She had right shoulder films that were not notable for \nfracture or dislocation. She was able to follow commands.\n\nThroughout the day the patient became difficult increasingly \ndifficult to understand. Per the translator the patient had a \ndifficult to understand ___ accent. The family was \ncontacted and per the family the patient was able to answer \nquestions but was more confused than she had been the previous \nday. It was thought that this was due to her presumed PNA. \nHowever given this AMS a head CT was ordered. The patient became \nincreasingly altered and when she was to be transported to have \nher head CT, she triggered for hypoxia. She was given \nnebulizers, had a CXR that showed increasing PNA and pulmonary \nedema. Azithromycin was added to her antibiotics and renal was \ncontacted and she had emergent dialysis. In addition she was \ntransfused 2 units of PRBCs while receiving dialysis. The \npatient stabilized from a respiratory standpoint and was taken \nfor a head CT that showed a large parenchymal hemorrhage in the \nleft parietal and temporal lobes with extension into the \nsubarachnoid and subdural spaces and intraventricular extent, \nand with severe associated mass effect. The patient was given \nmannitol and transfused platelets and transfered to the SICU \nwith neurosurgery.\n\nThere medical management was continued with platelet transfusion \nto a goal of greater than 50,000 and SBP <140. Given the large \nbleed and the progression of the altered mental status and \nlimited possibility of any recovery the patient was made \nDNR/DNI. She was transfered to the medical ICU where she was \ntransitioned to CMO. She was placed on a morphine drip and she \npassed away on ___.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Acetaminophen ___ mg PO Q6H:PRN pain \n2.

Re-demonstration of subarachnoid hemorrhage over the left \nparietal \nconvexity.  No new foci of hemorrhage. \n2. No evidence of mass, infarct, or abnormal enhancement after \ncontrast \nadministration. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ woman with history notable \nfor fibromyalgia and abnormal muscle biopsy who presents with 3 \ndays of severe abrupt-onset headaches, found to have convexal \nSAH on CT imaging at OSH. Follow-up MRI redemonstrated cSAH \nwithout evidence of underlying mass, vascular malformation, or \nmicrohemorrhages. Accordingly, in the absence of anatomic or \ntraumatic etiologies for the cSAH, suspicion was raised for \nreversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Although \nMs. ___ did not report recent changes to her SSRI, \nSSRI medications have been associated with worsening RCVS, so \nher escitalopram was discontinued. A review of her dietary \nsupplements also did not reveal a studied cause of worsening \nRCVS, though a recommendation was made to discontinue these \nmedications if a clear medical indication was not present given \nthe potential risk for interaction with her RCVS. Follow-up \narranged with vascular neurology for likely re-imaging to assess \nfor vasospasm, and encouraged follow-up with rheumatology to \ndiscuss alternate treatment options for fibromyalgia and with \noutpatient neurologist for review of muscle biopsy (which, per \n___ records, revealed abnormal mitochondrial morphology but did \nnot include a pathologic diagnosis of mitochondrial disease).\n\nShe should continue with Verapamil as a treatment for her RVCS \nuntil she sees Dr. ___ in clinic in a few months.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1. Consider repeat CT/CTA to assess for evidence of \nvasoconstriction.\n2. Please consider alternatives to SSRIs for management of \nfibromyalgia due to concern for vasoconstriction in setting of \nRCVS.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. melatonin 1 mg oral QHS \n2.

Imaging showed bleeding on \nthe surface of the back of your brain (called a convexal \nsubarachnoid hemorrhage) that was likely due to reversible \ncerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Although a clear \ntrigger for your RCVS was not found, SSRI-type medications such \nas your escitalopram have been associated with worsening RCVS, \nso we advise stopping this medication. Also, although a clear \nlink has not been established between your supplements and RCVS, \ndietary supplements are not regulated by the FDA, and we cannot \nguarantee that they would be safe to take with your condition; \naccordingly, it would be safest to avoid these medications and \ndiscuss whether they are necessary with your primary care \nprovider.\n\nPlease follow up with your primary care provider within one week \nof discharge. Please also follow up with your rheumatologist to \ndiscuss treatment options for your fibromyalgia. You will also \nhave follow-up with Neurology to check in on your RCVS.\n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.\n\nSincerely,\nNeurology at ___\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

You were found \nto have a moderate amount of fluid in the lung space that was \ncaused by the injury to your ribs.  A chest tube was placed to \nhelp drain this fluid from your lung space and was then later \nremoved.  You were given pain medication, supplemental oxygen, \nand encouraged to take deep breaths, walk, and cough to help \nyour body re-absorb the fluid. You are now doing better, oxygen \nlevels are adequate, and your pain is better controlled with \npain pills. You were evaluated by the physical therapist who \nrecommends discharge to home with continued physical therapy at \nhome. You will also have visiting nursing services come to your \nhome. \n\nPlease have a follow up chest xray done prior to your clinic \nvisit. \n\nPlease note the following discharge instructions:\n\n* Your injury caused left sided rib fractures which can cause \nsevere pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths \nbecause of the pain.\n \n* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead \nof the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If \nthe pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and \nnotify your physician.\n \n* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to \ndecrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 \ntimes every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small \nairways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that \npool in the lungs.\n \n* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold \nagainst your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and \ndeep breathing.\n \n* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short \nperiods may ease the pain.\n \n* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you \nshould take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid \nand fiber intake if possible.\n \n* Do NOT smoke\n \n* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs \nare very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, \nAdvil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side \neffects so make sure your doctor approves.\n \n* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute \nshortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation \naround your ribs (crepitus).\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

You may leave the bandage off. \nYou may have a small bruise around the puncture site.  This is \nnormal and will go away one-two weeks. \nActivity \nFor the first 48 hours: \n\u0095Do not drive for 48 hours after the procedure\nFor the first week:\n\u0095Do not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 \npounds\n\u0095Do not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold \nyour breath or bear down with abdominal muscles.   Take care not \nto put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, \nor moving your bowels.\nAfter one week:\n\u0095You may go back to all your regular activities, including \nsexual activity.  We suggest you begin your exercise program at \nhalf of your usual routine for the first few days.   You may \nthen gradually work back to your full routine.\n\nMedications:\nBefore you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all \nthe medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you \nnormally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not \ntake is on the list please discuss it with the team!  \n\nFor  Problems or Questions:\nCall ___ in an emergency such as:\n\u0095Sudden, brisk bleeding or swelling at the puncture site that \ndoes not stop after applying pressure for ___ minutes\n\u0095Bleeding that is associated with nausea, weakness, or \nfainting.\nCall the vascular surgery office (___) right away if \nyou have any of the following. (Please note that someone is \navailable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week)\n\u0095Swelling, bleeding, drainage, or discomfort at the puncture \nsite that is new or increasing since discharge from the hospital\n\u0095Any change in sensation or temperature in your legs\n\u0095Fever of 101 or greater\n\u0095Any questions or concerns about recovery from your angiogram \n\nOn the discharge worksheet, \u0093Key Information for Other \nProviders\u0094 must include:\nANTIBIOTICS: None\nANTICOAGULATION: Apixaban 5 mg twice daily\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n\n \nName:  ___                   Unit No:   ___\n \nAdmission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___\n \nDate of Birth:  ___             Sex:   F\n \nService: SURGERY\n \nAllergies: \nDuricef / gluten / vancomycin\n \nAttending: ___.\n \nChief Complaint:\nThoracic outlet syndrome with history of deep venous thrombosis \nand pulmonary embolism\n \nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n___: Right first rib resection and venolysis\n\n \nHistory of Present Illness:\n___ presents for follow-up of her lysis of her right \nsubclavian vein she underwent successful lysis and angioplasty.  \nThis is in the context of DVT and PE related to thoracic outlet \nsyndrome.\n\nShe is feeling quite a bit better her arm still swells but is \noverall significantly improved her pain is almost gone.  She \ncontinues on Eliquis.  Her ultrasound showed chronic DVT in the \narm but some flow through the subclavian vein which is an \nimprovement.  MDM had a long discussion with her and her mother. \nThink the best plan of action is first rib resection and venal \nlysis of the vein.

A \npreviously seen right-sided pneumothorax is not evident on \ntoday's study.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal \nstructures are within normal limits.  Postoperative changes are \nevident from a right first rib resection.\n\nPOD2 CXR, ___: \nIMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.  Right chest tube in similar \nposition.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ presented to ___ on ___ for planned right first \nrib resection for thoracic outlet syndrome associated with \nprevious DVT and pulmonary embolism. At the initiation of this \nprocedure the patient had an apparent allergic reaction which \nwas primarily cutaneous in nature (diffuse redness of skin) but \nalso associated with some hypotension which was treated \nsuccessfully with steroids and epinephrine by the \nanesthesiologist. As multiple drugs were given and products used \nin close succession, it is difficult to say exactly to which \nitem she was allergic. We have highest suspicion for vancomycin \nbut rocuronium was also administered around the same time. She \nhad also recently been prepped for surgery with a ChloraPrep \nscrub. For full details of this event and the remainder of the \nsurgery, which proceeded as planned, please see the operative \nnote and the anesthesia record. The patient was brought to the \nPACU and then surgical floor for further recovery in good \ncondition. A chest tube was left at the end of the case and \nplaced to suction. It was noted to have an air leak upon \nimmediate conclusion of surgery, however this resolved by \npost-operative check approximately 1 hour later. Two chest \nx-rays were reassuring for minimal to no pneumothorax and she \nmaintained saturations well. She consistently had a palpable \nright radial pulse from the end of the case until discharge and \nexperienced no swelling of the right arm.\n\nOn the surgical floor, the patient remained hemodynamically \nstable. She was started on a 5 day course of Benadryl and \nmethylprednisolone for her intraoperative allergic reaction and \nexperienced no recurrence of allergic symptoms while inpatient. \nHer chest tube was transitioned to water seal on the morning of \nPOD1. Chest x ray was reassuring and she was taken off the \nPleurevac and placed on JP bulb suction with another reassuring \nchest X ray taken afterward. JP outputs were monitored and found \nto be sanguinous-tinged serous in color and thin in quality. As \noutput was still in the 300-400 cc per day range as of the \nmorning of POD2, it was determined that she would be best served \nby completing JP teaching and chest tube teaching, arranging for \na visiting nurse, and arranging close clinic follow-up for tube \nremoval in the next few days. All of these were arranged. A \nmorning CXR on ___ was again reassuring. She continued to \nambulate, tolerate a diet, and remained hemodynamically stable \nwith no further allergic symptoms. On the afternoon of ___ she \ndid note some minor swelling of the left foot. She has a known \nhistory of lymphedema on this side and the swelling was \nmonitored for about two hours with no worsening on exam and some \nsubjective improvement reported by the patient. She continued to \nambulate and was instructed to call our clinic or answering \nservice if this swelling worsened or began to extend beyond her \nfoot. She was cleared for home with services and was instructed \nto restart home apixaban on discharge as well as to finish her \nsteroid and benadryl course. All instructions, particularly in \nregard to medications and chest drain care (including \ncontingencies if the bulb were to dislodge), were reviewed with \npatient and family prior to discharge, and all questions were \nanswered to their satisfaction.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were admitted to the hospital for surgery \nto remove your right first rib.  This surgery was done to \nrestore proper blood flow to and from your arm.  To perform this \nprocedure, an incision was made in your chest.\n\nYou tolerated the procedure well and are now ready to be \ndischarged from the hospital.   Please follow the \nrecommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful \nrecovery.\n\nFirst Rib Resection\n\nPatient Discharge Instructions \n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\nBruising, tenderness, mild swelling, numbness and/or a firm \nridge at the incision site is normal.  This will improve \ngradually in the next 2 weeks. \n\nIt is normal to feel tired for a few weeks after your surgery. \n\nMEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS:\nBefore you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all \nthe medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you \nnormally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not \ntake is on the list please discuss it with the team!  \n\nYou should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for neck \npain.  You may also take your prescription pain medication as \nneeded when the pain requires more than Tylenol.  You should \nrequire less pain medication each day.  Do not take more than a \ndaily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  Tylenol is used as an \ningredient in some other over-the-counter and prescription \nmedications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you are taking in a \nday.\n\nYou should continue to take Benadryl and methylprednisolone to \ncomplete a ___fter your allergic reaction in the \noperating room. Do not take Benadryl within an hour of taking \nany narcotic painkiller as this may cause too much sedation and \ndifficulty breathing. We cannot say for sure what caused your \nallergic reaction. We think the antibiotic vancomycin is the \nmost likely, but you also received rocuronium (a paralytic \nanesthetic drug used during surgeries) and ChloraPrep (a \nsurgical scrub) at around the same time.\n\nNarcotic pain medication can be very constipating.  If you take \nnarcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   \nIf constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest \nan additional over the counter laxative.  \n\nCARE OF YOUR INCISION: \nYou may shower.  Avoid direct shower spray to the incision \n(which is covered with skin glue) or chest tube site.  Let soapy \nwater run over the incisions, then rinse and gently pat the area \ndry.  Do not scrub.  Keep a gauze or drain sponge around the \nsite where your chest tube inserts to help make the tube as \ncomfortable as possible. \n\nACTIVITY: \nDo not drive for at least one week after your procedure.  Do not \never drive after taking narcotic pain medication. \n\nYou should not push, pull, lift or carry anything heavier than 5 \npounds for the next 2 weeks. \n\nAfter 2 weeks, you may return to your regular activities \nincluding exercise, sexual activitiy and work. \n\nDIET: \nIt is normal to have a decreased appetite.  Your appetite will \nreturn over time.  Follow a well-balanced, healthy diet.\n\nCHEST TUBE/DRAIN:\nWe have placed a tube into your chest to ensure your lung \nremains expanded and help drain any fluid to the outside of your \nbody rather than into your lung. Your lung is re-expanded on \nchest x-ray but you currently still require the tube to ensure \ngood drainage of the drainage from your surgical site. Your \nvisiting nurse ___ help you care for the device. Try to ensure \nthat the drain does not twist or kink. When the bulb is emptied, \nit is VERY IMPORTANT that the tube that connects to your chest \nis clamped off. This can be accomplished by using ___ clamp \nor chest tube clamp placed over a gauze onto the tube (the gauze \nis to protect the tube from cracks when pressure is placed on \nit).  \n\n* If your drain ever falls out or becomes disconnected from your \nbulb, the first thing you should do is reconnect the bulb and \ntape it securely. Then call our clinic or go to the ER. If the \nbulb is lost or you can't reconnect it, clamp the tube to \nprevent air from moving into your chest.*If you develop any \nchest pain or increased shortness of breath, please call \nimmediately or go to the emergency room.\n\nThe gauze dressing around your chest tube should be changed at \nleast every other day. \n\nShowering with a chest tube is okay. Do not submerge the tube or \nbulb device in water. No baths, swimming, or hot tubs. \n\nCALLING FOR HELP \nIf you need help, please call us at ___.  Remember your \ndoctor, or someone covering for your doctor is available 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week.  If you call during non-business \nhours, you will reach someone who can help you reach the \nvascular surgeon on call.  \n\nTo get help right away, call ___. \n\nCall the surgeon right away for:\n\u00b7     severe shortness of breath\n\u00b7     arm swelling, new or increasing arm tingling. If you \nexperience significant loss of sensation in the arm, or if the \narm turns blue or cold, go to the emergency room.\n\u00b7     headache that is not controlled with pain medication or \nheadache that is getting worse\n\u00b7     fever of 101 degrees or more\n\u00b7     bleeding from the incisions, drainage that is new or \nincreased, or drainage that is yellow or green from either the \nincision or the chest tube\n\u00b7     pain that is not relieved with medication, or pain that is \ngetting worse instead of better\n\nIf you notice any of the following signs of stroke, call ___ to \nget help right away.\n\u00b7     sudden numbness or weakness of the arm\n\u00b7     severe shortness of breath or increased pain with \nbreathing\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

Probable moderate layering pleural effusions \nalso exist. \nOpacification of the bases is greater than the upper lung zones, \nlikely de to underlying chronic interstitial lung disease seen \non prior chest radiographs and CT. Median sternotomy wires are \nintact. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. \nEvaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due to pleural \nfluid. There is no pneumothorax or definite focal consolidation. \nIMPRESSION:  1. New moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema \nsuperimposed upon known chronic interstial lung disease. \n2. Possible new bilateral pleural effusions.  \n.\nCT scan ___:\nKnown fibrotic changes, likely to reflect mild-to-moderate UIP.  \n\nNewly appeared ground-glass opacities in both lungs and in \ndiffuse \ndistribution, suggesting either acute exacerbation or \nsuperinfection, for \nexample with PCP.

Likely had CAP and CHF \nexacerbation with underlying IPF, improved with antibiotics, \nprednisone course and diuresis.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n==============\n# Hypoxemia: Initial differential included CHF, pneumonia or \nworsening UIP/IPF. Ruled out for flu. He was started on \nnon-rebreather and did not require intubation. He was diuresed \nwith IV lasix, started on high dose IV steroids and covered for \nCAP with Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone. He continued to require \n100% NRB on hospital day 2. High dose steroids were stopped for \none day as unclear whether IPF flare but re-started once CT \nchest findings more consistent with IPF and overlying pulmonary \nedema. He was weaned to 5 L nasal cannula with high-dose \nsteroids, aggressive diuresis (-4L) and antibiotics. He was \nstable after coming to the floor and was maintaining sats on 4L \nO2 nasal cannula. He completed a 5-day course of azithromycin \nand will have a total of 7-days of ceftriaxone/cefpodoxime. He \nwas restarted on his home lasix dose for continued diuresis and \nwas largely euvolemic on exam. Pulmonology evaluated patient and \nrecommended a taper of prednisone from 60mg over 2 weeks until \nfollow up with Dr. ___. He was started on bactrim prophylaxis \nwhile on steroids. Patient's initial hypoxemia was likely in the \nsetting of CHF exacerbation and community acquired pneumonia \ncausing severe symptoms given underlying structural disease due \nto IPF. Patient was discharged to rehab on ___ O2 and will \nlikely need temporary home O2 after going home. \n.\n# NSTEMI: Had elevated troponin which peaked at 0.25 with normal \nCK and CK-MB, no new ECG changes. TTE showed a posterior wall \nmotion abnormality which per Dr. ___ was seen on previous \nstudies, though the official read said this was new since ___. \nPatient had no chest pain or other symptoms. He was continued on \nASA 81mg, simvastatin 40mg, and on atenolol and lisinopril upon \ndischarge. He should follow up with his cardiologist as \noutpatient.\n.\n# Hemoptysis: patient had 2-week history of bloody sputum \nstarting 2 weeks prior to admission which gradually imprvoed \nthroughout hospitalization. His INR was supratherapeutic on \nadmission and coumadin was held as below. Small amounts of \nhemoptysis were likely due to infection or CHF with underlying \nIPF and supratherapeutic INR. At time of discharge, he did not \nhave any more blood tinged sputum and HCT remained stable.\n.\n# CHF: patient was slightly volume overloaded on admission with \nCT chest demonstrating ground glass opacities consistent with \nIPF and/or pulmonary edema. He was diuresed aggresively in the \nMICU with net negative output of 4L and improvement in \noxygenation. He was restarted on his home diuretic regimen at \ntime of discharge.\n.\n# Anemia - iron studies consistent with iron deficiency anemia, \nlikely mixed picture with anemia of chronic inflammation. \nPatient was started on ferrous sulfate supplementation with \nbowel regimen of senna, colace, and miralax. HCT remained stable \nat 32 throughout admission and should be trended as outpatient.\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n================\n# Atrial fib: On coumadin as outpatient, held in setting of \nsupratherapeutic INR and restarted at decreased dose on \ndischarge given azithromycin use. His INR at time of discharge \nwas 3.4 and coumadin dose was 4mg 4x/week and 2mg on the other 3 \ndays. He will have his INR rechecked at rehab.  \n.\n# Gout: Held colchicine on admission in setting of mildly \nelevated renal insufficiency and aggressive diuresis. This was \nrestarted after renal function normalized. No symptoms of gout \nflare throughout hospitalization.\n. \n# Obstructive Sleep Apnea: continued on cpap at night during \nhospital stay. \n.\n# GERD: Continued xantac\n.\nTRANSITION OF CARE:\n===================\n# INR check - in 2 days for goal INR ___. Coumadin dose at time \nof discharge was 4mg 4x/week and 2mg the other 3 days, INR was \n3.4.\n.\n# Anemia - should have HCT trended as outpatient and consider \nfurther work-up. Discharged on iron supplementation.\n.\n# Home oxygen - discharged to rehab on ___ O2 which should be \ntapered as tolerated. ___ need temporary course of home O2.\n.\n# Follow-up with pulmonology on ___ to possibly stop steroid \ntaper which was inititated for IPF on this hospitalization. Will \nalso have repeat PFTs at that time.\n.\n# Follow-up with cardiology regarding NSTEMI - discharged on \nASA, statin, atenolol, and lisinopril.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nATENOLOL - 25 mg Tablet - one Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nCALCITRIOL - 0.25 mcg Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth Daily\nCOLCHICINE - 0.6 mg Tablet - ___ Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nDISOPYRAMIDE [NORPACE CR] - 100 mg Capsule, Extended Release - 1\nCapsule, Sustained Release(s) by mouth twice a day\nFUROSEMIDE [LASIX] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 20 mg\nTablet - 2 (Two) Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day - lasix 40, 20 \npo\nLISINOPRIL - 5 mg Tablet - one Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nMETFORMIN - 850 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day new\ndose\nRANITIDINE HCL - 150 mg Capsule - one Capsule(s) by mouth twice \na\nday\nSIMVASTATIN - 40 mg Tablet - one Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nWARFARIN - 1 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily as needed \nfor\nwarfarin dose As directed by Coumadin provider\n___ - 2 mg Tablet - ___ Tablet(s) by mouth daily As \ndirected\nby Coumadin provider\n___ - 5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth four times weekly\n \nMedications - OTC\nASCORBIC ACID [VITAMIN C] -  (update omr) - 500 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s) by mouth daily\nASPIRIN [ASPIRIN LOW DOSE] -  (update omr) - 81 mg Tablet,\nDelayed Release (E.C.) - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily\nCYANOCOBALAMIN (VITAMIN B-12) [VITAMIN B-12] - 1,000 mcg Tablet \n-\n1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nMULTIVITAMIN WITH IRON-MINERAL -  (OTC) -   Tablet - 1 (One)\nTablet(s) by mouth once a day\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Repeated MRI with and thin slices \nthrough \nbrainstem is requested based on the initial noncontrast brain \nMRI results. \n  \nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \nperformed. After \nadministration of intravenous contrast, axial imaging was \nperformed with \ngradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 technique. Sagittal \nMPRAGE imaging was \nperformed and re-formatted in axial and coronal orientations.  \nAn axial FIESTA \nsequence through the brainstem was obtained. \n  \nCOMPARISON:  MR head ___. \n  \nFINDINGS:  \n  \nThere is stable appearance of the symmetric T2/FLAIR \nhyperintensity in the \nmedial aspect of the thalami bilaterally, which extends into the \nsuperior \nmedial aspect of the midbrain, as well as T2/FLAIR \nhyperintensity in the right \nsplenium of the corpus callosum.  These areas of FLAIR \nhyperintensity are \nagain noted to demonstrate hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted \nimages without \ncorresponding low ADC values.  Post-contrast images demonstrate \nassociated \nlinear contrast enhancement in the right splenium of the corpus \ncallosum \n(series 10, images 94-97), and faint curvilinear foci of \ncontrast enhancement \nin the medial right thalamus (series 11, image 14, series 10, \nimage 93, series \n1001, image 89). \n  \nThere are no new areas of hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted \nimages and \nthere is no slow diffusion. \n  \nThere is a chronic small to moderate infarct in the right \nparietal lobe with \nassociated gliosis.  Also again seen are T2/FLAIR \nhyperintensities in the \nsubcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter of the \ncerebral \nhemispheres, and in the bilateral pons, which are nonspecific \nbut likely \nsequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in this age \ngroup.  There is \nmild age-related prominence of the ventricles.  The sulci are \nnormal in size \nfor age. \n  \nAgain seen is a chronic punctate microhemorrhage in the left \nmiddle cerebellar \npeduncle, image 7:9. \n  \nMajor arterial flow voids are grossly preserved.  Dural venous \nsinuses a \npatent on postcontrast MP RAGE images.  Specifically, the \nstraight sinus is \npatent.  The internal cerebral veins and the veins ___ also \nappear \npatent. \n  \nMultiple contiguous right middle ethmoid air cells are \ncompletely opacified, \nas seen previously, with osseous remodeling on the preceding CT \nindicating \nchronicity.  There is mild mucosal thickening in bilateral \nanterior ethmoid \nair cells and frontoethmoidal recesses.  There is also trace \nfluid signal in \nthe mastoid air cells, which may be secondary to prolonged \nsupine positioning \nin the inpatient setting.  There is evidence of bilateral \ncataract surgery. \n  \nSagittal images again demonstrate mild degenerative changes in \nthe included \nupper cervical spine, incompletely evaluated. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n  \n  \n1. Stable appearance of the symmetric signal abnormalities in \nthe bilateral \nmedial thalami extending to the superomedial midbrain, and in \nthe right \nsplenium of the corpus callosum, on T2/FLAIR and diffusion \ntracer images, \nwithout corresponding low signal on the ADC map.  There is \nlinear contrast \nenhancement within the right splenium abnormality, and faint \ncurvilinear \ncontrast enhancement in the right medial thalamus.  The findings \nmay be \nsecondary to subacute infarction, which may be embolic in \nnature.  \nInflammatory and viral etiologies may also be considered.  \nNeoplastic etiology \nis less likely. \n2. Chronic small to moderate right parietal lobe infarct. \n3. Nonspecific bilateral supratentorial and pontine T2/FLAIR \nwhite matter \nhyperintensities, which likely represent the sequelae of chronic \n\nmicroangiopathy in this age. \n4. Chronic punctate microhemorrhage in the left middle \ncerebellar peduncle. \n5. Complete opacification of multiple right middle ethmoid air \ncells, with \nosseous remodeling on the preceding CT indicating chronicity. \n---------\n\nECG - sinus\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with past medical \nhistory of previous transient ischemic attacks and strokes \ncausing diplopia (evidence of prior bilateral thalamic stroke on \nbrain imaging), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, L3-L4 spinal \nstenosis, who was admitted to the stroke service with binocular \nhorizontal and vertical diplopia secondary to an acute ischemic \nstroke. His exam on admission was notable for left ptosis, \nlimited left eye abduction (appears down and out) and limited \nleft eye upgaze. He has left beating torsional nystagmus on left \nlateral gaze in left eye. Left eye ADDuction is full. He has \nbilateral restricted upgaze with limited downgaze, more \nprominent limited downgaze in his right eye. He has right NLFF \nwith delayed activation. He has dysmetria on FNF and HKS and an \nunsteady gait. He has ? physiologic anisocoria and is s/p \ncataract surgery (right pupil 3, left pupil 2). Imaging was \nnotable for CTA finding of an aortic arch atheroma, with \natherosclerosis in the origin of bilateral vertebrals \n(right?left) as well as an extracranial ICA plaque on the right \n(asymptomatic during admission). He underwent MRI brain which \ndemonstrated a small acute infarct in the midbrain, \nperiaqueductal, left side, also splenium on the left. He also \nhas bilateral paramedian thalamic infarcts without aDC correlate \nbut FLAIR correlate, suggesting more chronicity. He underwent \nMRI with contrast to rule out malignancy or inflammation and did \nnot show findings of enhancement in post contrast series. \nEtiology of stroke is likely athero-embolism, but cannot rule \nout cardio-embolic. TTE on admission was without PFO but was \nsubobtimal study. Telemetry was without arrhythmia. He will need \nZioPatch for 4 weeks to rule out paroxysmal A-Fib. Plan to \ncontinue patient on ASA 81mg daily, treat with Clopidogrel for 4 \nweeks, and start on Atorvastatin 80mg dialy ongoing.\n\nExam at time of DC: alert, eyepatch on right eye this am. Left \neye is downward and slightly inward. No conjugate vertical \ndiplopia. Right pupil slightly larger but both reactive to \nlight. Visual fields are full to confrontation. Face symmetric. \nWe appreciated some dysarthria but patient reports this being \nhis baseline. No pronator drift, intact strength in both arms. \nFinger-to-nose also intact bilaterally.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- STOP clopidogrel in 4 weeks (___)\n- Asymptomatic right ICA stenosis: Carotid US 60-69% (max PSV \n180cm/s in mid ICA).

The patient describes that subtle referential thinking\nbegan about 10 months ago, just around the time of the death of\nhis friend\u0092s father. At this time, he began attributing meaning\nto seemingly insignificant events, such as misplacing a bottle\nopener or the movement of a box outside of his house. These\nthoughts did not impact his functioning, and he minimized their\nsignificance at the time. However, approximately two weeks prior\nto presentation, the patient\u0092s brother was arrested for an\nunclear incident, where the brother was accused of \u0093stalking\u0094 a\ngroup of individuals over a period of years. This allegedly\nincluded monitoring people\u0092s whereabouts and other potential\nviolations of a civil/criminal nature. When this event occurred,\nthe patient and the rest of the family became involved and\nexposed to media attention, as well as being prompted with many\nunanswered questions regarding the behaviors of the patient\u0092s\nbrother. The patient reports that his brother stated that people\nwere in fact monitoring his activities and stated, \u0093my brother\nmight be the one getting screwed.\u0094 Since these allegations have\nsurfaced, the patient has experienced a severe amplification of\nparanoid thinking, ideas of reference, conspiratory delusions \nand\nother referential thought processes. While he admits that some \nof\nthe, \u0093connecting the dots\u0094 he is experiencing seems irrational,\nhe concurrently believes that many recent events are in fact\nconnected and represent a plot of some kind, \u0093I think the mob is\nprobably involved.\u0094 Examples of this delusional and referential\nthinking include removing the battery from his wireless phone\nthen sensing the presence of police around him, installing\ncameras on his property to monitor it, being convinced that his\ncomputer has been broken into regardless of repeated attempts to\nrepair it, feeling that the screws to his wife\u0092s care were\nremoved by someone on purpose, and feeling as though a number of\nvehicles followed him to the hospital from his home in ___\ntoday.

She had a blood \nculture which initially grew coag. neg staph and strep viridans \n___. She was sent to the emergency room. \nThe patient was started on vancomycin/gentamicin. She initially \ndevelopped a minor arm rash and itch to Vancomycin, but did not \nshow reaction on subsequent administration. Repeat TEE revealed \na large circumferential aortic root clear space. When compared \nto the previous TEE obtained from ___ (___), it was \nfelt that this could represent remnants of prior aortic sinus \ndilatation, although an annular abscess could not be excluded. \nOver the course of the hospitalisation, the patient remained \nafebrile and showed no signs of sepsis. There were no signs of \nembolic phenomena on physical examination or on CT imaging of \nthe chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI/MRA of the brain. Her \nneurological examination remained stable. Her EKG remained at \nbaseline. On ___, the patient suddenly developed \nhypotension and altered mental status. Repeat echo did not \nreveal any changes. Her condition rapidly improved post \nhydration. She remained asymptomatic after that.\nShe was seen by both cardiac surgery and infectious disease. \nBecause the echo changes were felt to be chronic, emergent \nsurgery was not deemed necessary. She had full pre-surgery \nwork-up and will be discharged home with a ___ access for \nlong-term antiobics. Follow-up appointments will be arranged \nwith CT surgery and ID.\n\n# Neurological symptoms  \nDuring the admission, the patient was noted to have ataxia on \nthe left upper extremities, indicating possible cerebellar \ninvolvement. In the context of a suspected emboli, a MRI/MRA of \nthe head was ordered to rule out emboli. A 3 mm aneurysm on the \ntrifurcation of the MCA was found. Neurosurgery was consulted \nand a CTA was ordered to better assess the morphology of the \naneurysm. The conclusion from the neurosurgical team was that \nthis was an incidental berry aneurysm. Follow-up imaging and \nneurosurgical appointments have been arranged.\n  \n# Kidney disease  \nPatient's creatinine ranged around 1.2 vs baseline of 0.8 ___ \nyears ago. She will need follow-up from her primary care \nphysician.\n.  \n# Hilar adenopathy\nMention of hilar adenopathy on CT scan which raises concern for \nsarcoidosis.

Enhancement is noted only in the periphery on the \npost-contrast images in these venous structures, and hence, \nthrombosis is a possibility.\n\nThere is no evidence of inflammation in the right orbit.\n\nThere is no significant discrepancy in the enhancement in the \ncavernous sinuses. The normal concavity of the lateral margin of \nthe cavernous sinus is noted.\n\nThere is increased signal noted in the maxillary sinuses, \nrepresenting fluid/mucosal thickening, with small retention cyst \nas well. Patient apparently is post-paranasal sinus surgery.\n\nOn the axial FLAIR sequence of the brain, there are multiple \nFLAIR hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter on both \nsides, which may represent sequelae of chronic small vessel \nocclusive disease. However, these are nonspecific in appearance, \nand there is no enhancement in these lesions on the \npost-contrast images. The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces \nare unremarkable.\n\nThere is no obvious proptosis on the present study.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Markedly dilated venous structures in the right orbit, \nrepresenting superior and inferior ophthalmic veins with \nslightly increased pre-contrast signal and decreased \nenhancement, likely related to slow flow/thrombosis.\n2. No discrepancy in the enhancement of the cavernous sinuses to \nsuggest cavernous sinus thrombosis. However, small \ncarotid-cavernous fistulous communication cannot be excluded \nbased on this study, as this is not the ideal study to evaluate \nfor CCF. Conventional angiogram can be considered if this is a \nclinical possibility after ophthalmologic and neurosurgical \nconsultations.\n3. No definite inflammation noted in the right orbit. No \nabscess.\n4. Multiple FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white \nmatter on both sides, representing most likely sequelae of \nchronic small vessel occlusive disease given the patient's age. \nHowever, these are nonspecific and need clinical correlation to \nexclude other etiologies.\n5. Moderate bilateral maxillary sinus fluid/mucosal thickening.\n.\nCHEST (PA & LAT)  ___ 5:34 ___\nFINDINGS: Two views are compared with study dated ___ and \nremote examination dated ___. There are new patchy, streaky \nopacities involving both lung bases, particularly posteriorly. \nWhile these most likely represent subsegmental atelectasis, \nearly pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded. The remainder of \nthe lungs is clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and \npulmonary vessels are within normal limits, with no pleural \neffusion. The aorta is tortuous, calcified and unfolded.\n.\nCT ORBITS, SELLA & IAC W/ CONTRAST  ___ 5:10 ___\nFINDINGS: There is mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid, \nsphenoid and maxillary sinuses with no fluid levels \ndemonstrated. The ostiomeatal units are patent.\n\nThere is mild-to-moderate proptosis of the right eye with an \napproximately 3 cm x 1 cm tubular structure extending from the \ninner angle of the orbit at the orbital rim to the likely \nsuperior orbital fissure, which represents a dilated superior \nopthalmic vein. The extraocular muscles are of normal size and \nappearance. There is no evidence of stranding of the intraconal \nfat or abnormal fluid collection.\n\nNo definite abnormality is appreciated in region of the \ncavernous sinuses, which appear homogeneously enhancing, with \nwell-opacified tortuous internal carotid arteries.\n\nThe surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable.\n\nThe left orbit is normal.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Markedly dilated right superior ophthalmic vein with \nresultant mild- moderate proptosis, not present on the enhanced \nMR examination dated ___. Possible etiologies include acute \ncavernous sinus thromosis or carotid- cavernous fistula (the \nlatter is less likely given the lack of trauma history, and the \ncongenital type is most unlikely, given the unremarkable \nappearance of this region previously). A dedicated enhanced MR \nstudy of the cavernous sinuses and orbits has been strongly \nsuggested.\n\n2. Mild diffuse paranasal sinus mucosal thickening consistent \nwith chronic sinus disease, which can relate to cavernous sinus \nthrombosis.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo male with multiple medical problems presents with b/l eye \nswelling.\n.\n1) Eye swelling/Transient decreased visual acuity\nInitially there was a question of cellulitis.  He was treated \nwith Unasyn.  However, the CT scan did not show any evidence of \ncellulitis.  The folliwing day, the patient's swelling had \nresolved.  Optho saw the patient and appreciated dilated \nophtalmic veins.  They recommended discontinuing antibiotics and \nhaving the patient follow up in clinic.  Given the possibility \nof thrombus of fistulous communication causing the dilated \nveins, an MRI of the orbits was performed (results as above).  \nThis showed dilated opthalmic veins with likely thrombus.  There \nis still a possibility of a carotid-cavernous fistula.  The test \nof choice to assess this would be an angiogram.  Opthalomology \ncan arrange for this once the patient is seen in clinic (it is \nnot an urgent or emergent study per the consult team).

She subsequently developed severe ARDS \nand hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring paralysis, septic \nshock requiring vasopressors, and acute renal failure requiring \nCRRT. She improved significantly from these illnesses, though \nher liver disease remained significant with a MELD-Na of 38. She \nhad also developed toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in the setting \nof her prolonged critical illness. She fell on ___ with \nresultant subdural hematoma. She had rapid deterioration of her \nneurologic exam, with a lack of brain stem reflexes by the time \nof neurosurgical intervention. She underwent craniotomy and \nevacuation of subdural hematoma, but her neurologic exam \nremained poor despite this. She ultimately progressed to brain \ndeath and died on ___.\n\n==============\nACUTE ISSUES\n==============\n\n# Hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of ARDS: The \npatient triggered for hypoxemia and tachypnea on the medicine \nservice on ___, and was subsequently transferred to the MICU, \nwhere she was intubated and sedated. Initial CXR consistent with \nARDS, and as a result the patient was started on lung-protective \nventilation. An esophageal balloon was placed to determine ideal \nPEEP settings. Neuromuscular blockade was used for 48 hrs for \nsevere ARDS. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. A \nmini-BAL was performed which was sterile. The patient was \nextubated on ___ following improvement in mental status and \nrespiratory mechanics. She was weaned to room air following \nextubation.\n\n# Septic Shock: Patient was hypotensive requiring placement of \ncentral venous cathether with pressor infusion. She was treated \nwith broad spectrum antibiotics and her vasopressor requirement \nultimately resolved.\n \n#Acute renal failure: Patient became anuric while in the MICU, \nsecondary to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of shock. \nNephrology was consulted, and the patient was initiated on CVVH \nafter placement of dialysis catheter. CVVH was discontinued on \n___ when the patient was extubated, with plan to pursue \nintermittent hemodialysis. The patient tolerated a session of \nintermittent hemodialysis well on ___. \n\n# Alcoholic Hepatitis: MDF on admission was ___, Child ___ C. \nAcetaminophen, viral hepatitis labs negative, autoimmune \nhepatitis titers within normal limits. EGD was performed without \nevidence of varices. Steroids were held upon admission and were \nnot started upon MICU transfer out of concern for infection / \nsepsis. Nutrition was consulted, and the patient was maintained \non tube feeds while intubated and sedated. She was continued on \nthiamine and multivitamin, with rifaximin and lactulose to \nprevent hepatic encephalopathy. She had significant \nleukocytosis, likely due to alcoholic hepatitis, as her cultures \nwere all negative.\n\n# Fall Resulting in Subdural Hematoma: Patient attempted to exit \nbed in the late afternoon on ___ without assistance, resulting \nin a fall. Patient was found down at 17:20 by nursing, \napparently struck the front of her face, and was noted to have \nbleeding from her upper lip and nose (Dobhoff had been displaced \nduring the fall). Upon initial neurologic examination, patient \nwas found to be neurologically intact, including cranial nerve \nand strength examination. Obvious injuries included hematomas on \nher bilateral knees and bleeding from the upper lip. The family \nwas informed of the initial event. She was continuously observed \nand approximately 30 minutes later was noted to be unresponsive \nto verbal or tactile stimuli. Pupils were 4mm and reactive \nbilaterally at that time. A stat non-contrast head CT was \nordered which demonstrated a large subdural hematoma with \nmidline shift. The patient was intubated for airway protection \nand neurosurgery was urgently consulted. The patient was \nadministered 2 units of FFP and 10mg IV vitamin K. Prior to \nsurgery, her neurologic exam was notable for fixed and dilated \npupils, and her family was counseled that surgery was unlikely \nto meaningfully improve her neurologic exam. The patient \nunderwent R-sided craniotomy, with evacuation of subdural. \nMidline shift persisted post-operatively, and pupils remained \nfixed. A family meeting was held on ___ with discussion of the \nprior day's events, surgical outcome, and grim prognosis. The \npatient's family expressed wishes to continue with supportive \ntherapy, and as a result patient was transfused pRBCs for \nongoing bleeding at the site of the craniotomy, as well as an \nadditional 5mg IV vitamin K for coagulopathy. By the afternoon \nof ___, physical examination was concerning for lack of \nbrainstem reflexes, though she intermittently breathed above the \nventilator. Multiple family meetings were held to explain the \ngrave prognosis and elicit concerns. On ___, pt lacked all \nbrainstem reflexes. A breath death scan was performed on ___ \nwhich was demonstrated no cerebral blood flow. An apnea test was \nconsistent with brain death. The patient was terminally \nextubated on ___ at 2300, with time of death pronounced on \n2334. Condolences were offered to the patient's family, who were \nat bedside at the time death was pronounced.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

There is no \nelectrophysiologic evidence for a generalized disorder of motor \nneurons as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  \n\nCT abdomen ___\n\nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1.  No clear evidence to suggest malignancy in the abdomen or \npelvis. \n2.  Distended gall bladder filled with stones.  Trace \ninflammatory change \nimmediately posterior to the GB.  These findings raise concern \nfor but are not entirely diagnostic of acute cholecystitis.  If \npatient has abnormal LFT's or right upper quadrant tenderness, \nfurther evaluation with ultrasound is recommended. \n\nCT Chest ___\n\nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1.  3.2-cm (TRV) x 4.1-cm (AP) x 4.7-cm (CC) heterogeneous mass \nin the region of the left lobe of the thyroid (3;8), which \nlaterally displaces the left carotid from the larynx, and may \ninvade the cricoid cartilage, \ncricopharyngeus, upper esophagus, innominate and left subclavian \narteries.   \n  \nNOTE: This could be secondary to thyroid cancer, however this \nmass is highly concerning for a squamous cell carcinoma. A \ndedicated neck CT is recommended for further evaluation. \n  \n2.  Multiple nodules in the right lung measuring up to 5-mm. \nGiven that the neck mass is highly suspicious for malignancy, a \n6-month follow up is \nrecommended to assess for stability of the nodules. \n\nCT Neck ___\n\nIMPRESSION:  4.6 cm mass adjacent to or arising from the left \nlobe of the \nthyroid.  Further characterization with ultrasound can be \nconsidered, but \nultimately biopsy would be required for definitive diagnosis.  \nNo cervical lymphadenopathy. \n\nCytology Report ___\nCYTOLOGY REPORT - Final\nSpecimen(s) Submitted:  FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION, THYROID\nDiagnosis  FNA, Thyroid, Left.\nSpecimen Adequacy:     Adequate.\nGeneral Category:      Positive for keratinizing squamous cell\ncarcinoma\n\nNote: Tumor cells are positive for TTF-1, but negative for\nthyrogobulin and p16 (pathcy non-specific pattern).  Primary \nthyroid\nsquamous cell carcinoma is favored based on location and TTF-1\nstaining. The tumor is high-grade. Dr. ___ \n___ were\ninformed on the diagnosis on ___ by Dr. ___.\n\nCT HEAD ___\nFINDINGS:\n \nThere is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or acute \nlarge vascular territory infarction.  Prominent ventricles and \nsulci suggest age-related atrophy.  Periventricular white matter \nhypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic \ndisease.  The basal cisterns appear patent and there is \npreservation of gray-white differentiation.\n \nNo fracture is identified.  The visualized paranasal sinuses, \nmastoid air\ncells and middle ear cavities are clear.  Atherosclerotic mural \ncalcification of the internal carotid arteries is noted.  The \nglobes are unremarkable.\n \nIMPRESSION:\nNo acute intracranial process.\n\nFDG-PET ___\nINTERPRETATION:\nComparison is made to CT neck ___\n \nHEAD/NECK: There is a large 5.9 x 4.3cm FDG avid (SUVMax 27.9) \ncervical mass extending from the hyoid bone to the thoracic \ninlet.  There is no FDG avid cervical adenopathy.\n \nCHEST: Multiple foci of FDG avidity in the lungs correspond to \nground glass\npulmonary opacities in the superior left lower lobe (image 80), \nposterior right middle lobe and right lower lobe (image 87).  \nThere is an 11 x 16mm solid nodule in the medial left lower lobe \nwhich is not FDG avid (image 93).\n \nABDOMEN/PELVIS: There is a small volume of pneumoperitoneum.  \nThere is mild FDG avidity and subcutaneous air surrounding the \ngastrostomy tube tract (image 124).

There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and \nregional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is \nmildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nare mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The \nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is \nan anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat \npad. \n\nIMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant \nvalvular disease seen (adequate-quality study). Mild symmetric \nleft ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional \nbiventricular systolic function. ___ presence of high clinical \nsuspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic \nechocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.\n\nCT SINUS (___):\nFINDINGS: There is a new large air collection with an air-fluid \nlevel ___ the left pre-maxillary soft tissue, measuring 12 x 15 \nmm (image 2:9).

Given the patient had recent \ndebridement and biopsy of dental implant, the constellation of \nfindings most likely represents iatrogenic subcutaneous air from \nthe recent procedure. However, if the patient presents with \nrapidly deteriorating symptoms, necrotizing fasciitis must be \nconsidered.  \n  \nThere is significant mucosal thickening ___ the left maxillary \nsinus, with \nevidence of left antrostomy. The right maxillary sinus has \nminimal mucosal \nthickening. The remaining paranasal sinuses are clear. The nasal \nseptum is \nmildly deviated to the right. A concha bullosa is incidentally \nnoted ___ the right upper turbinate. \n  \nAllowing the limit due to the absence of IV contrast, there is \nno evidence of abscess.

We have imaged your brain with CT and found you to \nhave a new left sided bleed which was stable throughout your \nadmission. We compared it to your previous MRI and think this is \ndue to a combination of your blood pressure and accumulation of \nprotein plaques in the brain.  \n\nThe brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all \nthe other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being \ndeprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of \nsymptoms.  \n\nDuring your admission we performed the following interventions:  \nstopped your ibuprofen or any medication that contains the words \nNSAIDs on the label as these can increase your bleeding risk. We \nadded a blood pressure medication called propranolol 80mg oral \ndaily to control your blood pressure while preventing your \nheadaches. You will need follow up with your primary care doctor \nin terms of increasing the dose as needed. We have asked you to \nmonitor your blood pressure daily and keep a log to take to your \nPCP. You will need follow up with the neurology department, as \nbelow.

Currently with a negative work-up. There were several \nconcerns. He had a leukocytosis and fever to 103 in the ED, WBCs \non his UA, with concern for chronic aspiration and a midline \nline IV in place on admission. Blood, lung, and urine were all \npotential sources. He had cultures sent for all three sources \nand had been covered with levo, flagyl, and vanc at his NH. His \nurine culture was negative, sputum grew yeast and respiratory \nflora and his blood cultures were NGTD at discharge. He was \ninitially covered broadly with vanc and imipenem out of concern \nfor aspiration, but CXR and sputum pointed away from this. He \nwas narrowed after 48 hours to Ciprofloxacin and remained \nafebrile. His midline was removed. \n\n# Hyponatremia. 150 on admission, likely from decrease in PO \nintake, and inability to access free water with increased \ninsensible losses. He was given 2L NS in the ED and Repleted \nwith D5W at 125cc/hr which corrected his sodium to 143. He was \nable to take fluids PO without coughing. He will need a formal \nspeech and swallow evaluation to determine what he will be able \nto take by mouth going forward. \n\n# Frontotemporal dementia/Parkinsonism. He failed a trial of \ntreatment in the past with worsening psychosis on \nantiParkinsonian meds. Currently on bupropion and mirtazapine \nand treating insomnia with lorazepam.\n\n# Somnolence: Unclear etiology during his stay. He had waxing \nand waning and the differential included hypoactive delirium \ncomplicated by acute illness. Also likely a medication effect. \nHe had received metoclopramide standing during admission. This \nwas discontinued for somnolence. His psychiatric medications \nwere also held for 1 dose and bupropion was halved in dosing to \n37.5mg BID, with mirtazapine and lorazepam being made prn due to \nsomnolence. As he continues to clinically improve his \nmedications can be uptitrated as he tolerates to his regular \ndosing. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

History from family notable for \nthe loss of two of sons, one by ___ ___ years ago and the other \nin ___ at patient's house, with patient being the one who found \nhim. Patient's apparent decline started in ___ with memory \ndifficulties and occasional episodes of confusion, and \nprogressed more recently to persistent worry about locking the \ndoors, communication with his family about being safe, \"down\" \nmood, poor appetite, energy, and poor concentration. Mental \nstatus examination was notable for a well nourished man with \nadequate hygiene and grooming with intermittently low mood, \nsomewhat blunted affect, and thought process that could be \nsomewhat disorganized at times. Cognitive examination notable \nfor deficits in short term memory and executive functioning with \nneuroimaging on ___ (CT without contrast) notable for prominence \nof the ventricles and sulci suggestive of involuntional change \nand periventricular and subcortical white matter matter \nhypodensities are nonspecific, but likely reflect sequelae of \nchronic small vessel ischemic disease. \n. \nGiven lack of any formal psychiatric history prior to \napproximately ___ years ago with family noting gradual decline \nover the past few years with apparent periods of confusion, \nforgetfulness, paranoia and cognitive examination as noted \nabove, etiology of presentation is most likely consistent with \nunderlying neurocognitive disorder (likely vascular dementia \ngiven patient's cardiovascular risk and imaging findings) with \nbehavioral disturbances and psychotic and depressive features. \n. \n#.

Once patient's behavior returned to \nhis baseline, he was progressively switched to 5 minue checks \nand ultimately to 15 minute checks by the time of discharge.  \n.\n#. Neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbances and \npsychotic and depressive features: \nFor depressive symptoms (predominantly sad mood and \ntearfulness), patient was started on sertraline that was \nuptitrated to 75 mg PO daily by the time of discharge. For \ninsomnia, patient received 8 mg PO ramelteon QHS with good \neffect.\nAfter risks and benefits of initiating an atypical antipsychotic \nwere discussed with patient and his family, patient was briefly \ntrialed on low dose risperidone (0.25-0.5 mg a day) that did not \nappear to be effective in alleviating patient's paranoid \nideation or behavioral disturbances. Patient was then switched \nto low dose olanzapine (2.5 mg PO QHS and 2.5 mg PO DAILY:PRN \nfor severe anxiety/agitation), which resulted in a modest \nimprovement in patient's anxiety and paranoid ideation and \nresolution of behavioral disturbances. Patient tolerated \nsertraline, risperidone and ramelteon well and consistently \ndenied any side effects.\nBenzodiazepines and anticholinergic medications were avoided \nduring the admission as much as possible.\n.\nPatient was encouraged to attend groups and was provided with \nmilieu, supportive psychotherapy and psychoeducation. He was \nreluctant about participating in groups at first but by the time \nof discharge went to at least one group a day and made relevant \ncontributions to discussions. \nPatient's family was educated about his condition and about the \nbenefits of frequent re-orientation and patient being in a \nfamiliar environment. Patient's family was encouraged to use ___ \nand Senior Services of ___, as well as to take \npatient to a senior ___ in their community for day \nprograms.\n.\nDuring his hospitalization, patient had one behavioral episode \nthat required use of chemical and physical restraints. On ___ \npatient choked on a chicken bone at dinner, and Heimlich \nmaneuver was used successfully. Despite the expulsion of the \nbone during the Heimlich maneuver, patient complained of \ncontinued discomfort in his throat and was taken for a neck \nX-ray. On his way to radiology, patient pushed the staff member \naccompanying him and tried eloping. He was agitated and \nphysically aggressive toward staff members who came to escort \nhim back to the unit, and chemical and physical restraints had \nto be used. Patient was not injured in the process and tolerated \nthe restraints well. Physical restraint was discontinued as soon \nas patient was no longer danger to self or others, and patient \nwas placed on security CO. Once patient's behavior returned to \nhis baseline, he was progressively switched to 5 minute checks \nand ultimately to 15 minute checks by the time of discharge.\n.\nBy discharge, patient's mood has improved with less sadness and \nlability, his anxiety and paranoid ideation became less frequent \nand more tolerable (with patient being able to cope with them \nwithout acting out), and patient was notably future-oriented \nlooking forward to spend time with his grandchildren.\n.\n#. Medical:\nPatient has a history of hypertension, trigeminal neuralgia, \nglaucoma, diet controlled type II diabetes mellitus and \nsubclinical hypothyroidism. Patient's home medication regimens \nwere continued as following:\n- for hypertension, patient was continued on hydrochlorothiazide \n12.5 mg PO daily, atenolol 25 mg PO daily and lisinopril 40 mg \nPO daily;\n- for trigeminal neuralgia, patient was continued on Trileptal \n300 mg PO BID;\n- for glaucoma, patient was continued on timolol maleate 0.5% 1 \ndrop both eyes daily.\nPatient's type II diabetes mellitus continued being controlled \nby diet with HgbA1c of 6.0 on ___ and daily glucose finger \nsticks in the 97-206 range.\n.\nRegarding the choking on chicken bone incident: portable neck \nX-ray was negative for foreign bodies, and fiberoptic \nexamination of patient's throat did not reveal any foreign \nbodies, masses or significant lesions other than some posterior \ninflammation suggestive of GERD.

Please note, more advanced forms of liver disease \ncannot be excluded on the basis of this appearance.  Normal \ngallbladder. \n\n___ TTE:\nConclusions   \n The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. \nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global \nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac \nindex is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler \nimaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left \nventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of \naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good \nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with \ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. \nThe estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\n IMPRESSION: Normal study. Normal biventricular cavity sizes \nwith preserved regional and global biventricular systolic \nfunction. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.\n If the clinical suspicion for myocarditis or pericarditis is \nmoderate or high, a cardiac MRI is suggested. \n CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:  Based on ___ AHA endocarditis \nprophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate \nprophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the \nneed for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and \nechocardiographic data.  \n\nMICROBIOLOGY\n============\n___ bcx pending\n\nDISCHARBE LABS\n==============\n___ 07:00AM BLOOD WBC-7.9 RBC-4.81 Hgb-14.3 Hct-42.6 MCV-89 \nMCH-29.7 MCHC-33.6 RDW-12.7 RDWSD-41.2 Plt ___\n___ 07:00AM BLOOD Plt ___\n___ 07:00AM BLOOD Glucose-107* UreaN-10 Creat-1.2 Na-138 \nK-4.1 Cl-105 HCO3-24 AnGap-13\n___ 07:00AM BLOOD ALT-23 AST-29 AlkPhos-48 TotBili-0.4\n___ 07:00AM BLOOD Calcium-9.4 Phos-3.9 Mg-2.___RIEF HISTORY\n=============\nMr. ___ is a ___ man with h/o hypertriglyceridemia and a \nheart murmur as a child who presents with chest tightness and \nfound to have troponin elevation. There were no ischemic changes \nto his EKG, and his TTE was normal. His troponins and CKMB \npeaked on ___ and the patient was discharged to home with \nscheduled follow up with a cardiac MRI.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=============\n# Chest pain with troponin elevation: Most concerning for ACS, \nthough EKG without acute ischemic changes, TTE without regional \nwall motion abnormality, chest pain atypical nature, and pt's \nyoung age makes this very unlikely. Viral myocarditis thought to \nbe most likely etiology. Demand ischemia also possible, though \nwithout a very clear inciting event. Initially felt to have \nglobal hypokinesia on a bedside TTE, but a formal TTE on ___ \nwith normal EF and no regional wall motion abnormalities. Also \nconsidered cardiomyopathies from other etiologies, such as \nfamilial (no known h/o CM), infectious (pt with recent viral vs \nbacterial gastroenteritis), toxic (pt denies heavy EtOH use or \nother drugs), infiltrative (amyloid, sarcoid, hemochromatosis, \ntumor), autoimmune (polymyositis, SLE, scleroderma, RA, PAN, \neosinophilic, giant cell), Takotsubo (no apical ballooning), \nARVC. Pt not tachycardic. Also can consider metabolic causes \n(hypothyroid, acromegaly, pheo, OSA, thiamine, selenium or \ncarnitine defic). TSH wnl. HAV, HBVsAg, HCV negative. HBV \nnon-immune. IgM wnl. HIV neg. A1c 5.6%. Troponin peaked at 0.44, \nCK-MB also peaked at 17 on ___ ___. Transferrin sat ~9%, low \nconcern for hemochromatosis. Elevated ___ (460) on a non-fasting \npanel, and unchanged from prior known levels. Cholesterol panel \notherwise wnl. Pt was kept on a heparin gtt until formal TTE \nmost likely ruled out ischemic etiology. Pt was on ASA 81, \nmetoprolol, and atorvastatin through his stay and was \ndiscontinued at discharge. Pt needs to receive cardiac MRI as \noutpatient\n\n# Elevated D-dimer: Most likely representation of acute phase \nreactant in setting of viral illness. Patient without any \nresting tachycardia, O2 requirement, or dyspnea at any point \nduring admission to suggest PE. PERC score 0. \n\n# Fatty steatosis with RUQ TTP: On admission, LFTs normal, \nslightly increased lipase. Fatty steatosis seen on RUQ \nultrasound in ED. NAFLD diagnosis requires imaging, exclusion of \nsignificant EtOH consumption, and exclusion of other causes of \nhepatic steatosis. HAV, HBVsAg, HCV negative. Low concern for \nhemochromatosis with Transferrin sat 9%. High ___ at 460 (but \nnon-fasting and unchanged from prior outpatient levels). \nCholesterol levels otherwise wnl. Pt with mild TTP on RUQ at \ntime of discharge, but improved from admission, and would \nrecommend outpatient follow up. Would also recommend decreasing \nalcohol use and increasing exercise.\n\n # Diarrhea: Pt had it from ___, when was in ___.  He had \nbeen taking Imodium prior to admission. Pt had formed stool on \n___.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n==============\n # HLD: Pt reports being told to take fish oil for high \ncholesterol last year, but on recheck this year despite not \ntaking fish oil, his numbers improved.  High ___ at 460 (but \nnon-fasting and unchanged from prior outpatient levels), and \nmildly elevated lipase. Cholesterol levels otherwise wnl. We \nwould recommend further evaluation and management as an \noutpatient. We also recommended increasing exercise.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n-No new medications on discharge\n-F/u Cardiac MRI on ___ at 11:30am\n-Pt should decrease alcohol intake\n-Encouragement to increase exercise, possibly start fish oil \n(was recommended previously but pt did not take) to improve \ndyslipidemia\n\n# CODE: Full Code (confirmed) \n# CONTACT: ___ (father) ___ (c), secondary \nNevine ___ (mother) ___ (c)\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n \nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nChest discomfort with troponin elevation\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nDear Mr. ___, \n\nYou were admitted to the hospital because your chest discomfort \nwas associated with an elevated blood enzyme that was concerning \nfor a heart abnormality.\n\nWhile you were here, you received an ultrasound of your heart \nthat showed a normal heart function. Your EKGs (electrical \nactivity of your heart) did not show evidence of a heart attack. \nYour blood enzymes peaked and started downtrending on ___. \nWhile you were here, you were initially on continuous heparin \nwhile ruling out an ischemic cause, and also received metoprolol \n(for possible low ejection fraction), aspirin, and atorvastatin. \nYou were NOT discharged with these medications because we did \nnot feel they were necessary. \n\nMoving forward, please follow up with your primary care doctor. \nWe have made an appointment for you with a new primary care \ndoctor in the local area so that you can visit him/ her while \nyou are studying in ___.

No intracranial mass or \nlesion\n \nCXR ___  \nNo previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper \nlimits of normal or mildly enlarged and there is tortuosity of \nthe aorta.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests \nsome elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  No acute pneumonia or \npleural effusion. \n\nMRI ___\nFINDINGS:  \nThe examination is mildly motion degraded.  Within these \nconfines: \nThere is no intra or extra-axial mass, acute hemorrhage or acute \ninfarct.  Left middle frontal gyrus white matter FLAIR \nhyperintensity (series 13, image 17) corresponding to \nhypodensity seen on outside hospital CT examination may \nrepresent sequela of prior infarct. There are superimposed \nperiventricular and subcortical T2/FLAIR white matter \nhyperintensities, which are nonspecific, but compatible with \nchronic microangiopathy in a patient of this age.  There is no \nabnormal postcontrast enhancement. \n \nThe major intracranial flow voids are preserved.  The dural \nvenous sinuses are patent on postcontrast MP-RAGE.  The \nparanasal sinuses are essentially clear.  \nThe orbits are unremarkable.  The mastoid air cells are clear. \n\n___ Head w/ and w/o contrast\n1. No acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. \n2. No abnormal enhancement. \n3. Additional findings as described above. \n\n___ Head and Neck\n1. Left middle frontal white matter hypodensity, likely \nrepresenting sequela \nof chronic infarct. \n2. Otherwise no acute intracranial abnormality including acute \nlarge \nterritorial infarct or hemorrhage. \n3. Patent intracranial vasculature without significant stenosis, \nocclusion, or \naneurysm. \n4. Mild narrowing at the origins of the bilateral vertebral \narteries.  \nOtherwise patent cervical vasculature without significant \nstenosis, occlusion \nor dissection. \n5. Moderate to severe centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema. \n\n___ R shoulder\nPossible diffuse osteopenia.  No fracture or dislocation is \ndetected about the \nright shoulder.  The AC and glenohumeral joints are congruent, \nwith mild \ndegenerative change.  No bone erosion, aggressive osteolysis or \nperiosteal new \nbone formation is identified.  The acromial humeral distance is \npreserved.  \nThe adjoining portion of the right chest walls grossly \nunremarkable. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nNo fracture or aggressive lesion detected involving the right \nshoulder. \n\n___\nThis is an abnormal continuous EMU monitoring study because of \nmild slowing of the background consistent with a mild \nencephalopathy, which is \nnon-specific but may be secondary to medications, \ntoxic-metabolic disturbances \nor infection. There are no epileptiform discharges. There are \ntwo clinical \nevents for head turning to the right.

During \nthe entire hospitalization here, pt remained asymptomatic, \nwithout EKG changes or cardiac biomarker elevations.  He \nunderwent successful cardiac catheterization, which showed \nmultivessel coronary artery disease, including 40% LM, 40% LCx, \n90% D1, 50% D2 diseases.  No intervention was made given his \nactive GIB and risk of antiplatelet treatment.  His surface ECHO \nshowed normal LV function with preserved EF at 55% and 1+ AR.  \nPt was given aspirin 325 mg, without plavix given active UC \nflare.  We also started him on atorvastatin 80 mg daily, and \nuptitrated carvediolol to 12.5 mg twice a day.\n  \n# ULCERATIVE COLITIS FLARE: Pt was found to have ___ at \noutside hospital.  Multiple biopsy were consistent with \nulcerative colitis flare.  His infectious workup were negative \nat ___ (negative C.diff and negative stool culture). \n Pt was evaluated by the gastroenterology team during this \nadmission.  He was treated with mesalamine 800 mg tid (bid at \nhome), and iv methylprednisolone 20 mg tid.  During this \nadmission, pt had intermittent loose stool and rectal bleed.  \nHis WBC remains elevated upto 18, with no bandemia.  His blood, \nurine culture and C.diff remained negative.  Inflammatory \nmarkers, including CRP and ESR were negative.  He otherwise \nremained afebrile, with no abdominal symptoms, and tolerated \nregular oral diet well.  One unit pRBC was given on ___, and \nappropriate HCT improvement was observed.  Pt was switched to \noral prednisone 40 mg on ___, and remained stable for 24 \nhours.  \n\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Pt was found to have ___ atrial \nfibrillation, with CHADS score of 2.  No anticoagulation was \ngiven considering his active GI bleed.  He spontaneously \nconverted to sinus rhythm prior to discharge.\n\n# Fall: Pt had a fall on ___.  He reported feeling dizzy at \nnight while going to the bathroom, and fell to the ground.  The \nevent was not witnessed, and there appears to be no loss of \nconsciousness as reported by nursing staff who came shortly \nafterwards.  The nature of the fall is likely mechanical vs \npresyncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension.  Pt was found \nto be mildly orthostatic with BP 152/70 decreasing to 130/68, \nand HR 65 increasing to 75 upon standing.  This is likely in the \nsetting of ulcerative colitis flare and blood loss.  A CT head \nwas performed, with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  \nThere were no recorded arrhythmia on telemetry.  His \nneurological exam was intact after the event.  \n  \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# Hypertension: Pt has documented history of hypertension.  His \nblood pressure was found to be above his baseline.  A renal \nartery ultrasound was performed, which did not reveal stenosis.  \nThis is felt most likely a result of steroid use.  We \ndiscontinued his atenolol and uptitrated carvediolol to 12.5 mg \ntwice a day.\n  \n# Hyperlipidemia: We started pt on atorvastatin for better \ncholesterol control given the diagnosis of angiography proven \ncoronary artery disease. \n  \nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n# CODE STATUS: Full\n# PENDING STUDIES: \n  - Blood culture ___ pending\n# MEDICATION CHANGES\n  - START aspirin 325 mg daily\n  - CHANGE pravastatin to atorvastatin 80 mg daily\n  - CHANGE atenolol to carvediolol 12.5 mg bid\n  - INCREASE mesalamine to 800 mg tid\n  - START prednisone 40 mg daily with a slow taper of 10 mg \nevery week to 20 mg and 5 mg every week afterwards.  The taper \nshould be followed by his outpatient gastroenterologist\n# FOLLOWUP PLAN\n  - Home ___ service\n  - PCP followup \n  - ___ followup\n  - Consider decreasing aspirin to 81 mg one month after the \nNSTEMI\n  - Consider uptitrate mesalamine to maintenance therapy\n  - Please arrange cardiology followup for his coronary artery \ndisease and may consider intervention once ulcerative colitis is \nin control\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You had a CAT scan as well as an \nMRI to evaluate the extent of the infection.  The imaging showed \nthat the infection was tracking along the surgical site.  \nHowever, there was no large pocket of pus to drain.  You were \nstarted on intravenous antibiotics and responded well - the \nredness, warmth, tenderness and drainage all improved.  Because \nof this, it was determined that you did not need surgical \nintervention to treat the infection.  On discharge, you will \ncontinue IV antibiotics as per instructions below.\n.\nThe MRI also showed that the tumor ___ your pelvis has increased \n___ size since the last imaging studies and was interfering with \nthe hardware placed during your surgery.  The orthopedic \nsurgeons evaluated you to assess whether or not the tumor should \nbe removed. Such a surgery would be extremely complicated and \nrequire a multidisciplinary team and extensive planning. You \nshould follow up with Dr. ___ and ___ \n___ as an outpatient to further discuss the \npossibility of surgery.\n.\nThe CAT scan also showed a fracture ___ your left pelvis, which \nis a pathalogic fracture from cancer ___ your bone.  The \northopedic surgeons evaluated you for this as well and provided \nyou with instructions on activity limitations.  The radiation \noncology team also saw you to assess whether or not more \nradiation would be beneficial.  It was felt that since you had \nalready received a large dose of radiation, additional treatment \nwould not be helpful.\n.\nWe have scheduled multiple appointments for you on ___, \nplease see below.\n.\nWe have started you on the following medications:\n-START Nafcillin 2mg IV every 4 hours\n-STOP Sunitibin (Sutent) ___ the setting of an infection\n-START Miralax and Lactulose for constipation (prescriptions \nprovided)\n.\nYou should also have your blood work checked weekly and results \nfaxed to the infectious disease clinic at ___.  \nPrescriptions for lab draws provided.\n.\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you, we wish you all the best.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n\n \nName:  ___                  Unit No:   ___\n \nAdmission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___\n \nDate of Birth:  ___             Sex:   M\n \nService: MEDICINE\n \nAllergies: \nCodeine / Iodine / Glucocorticoids,Systemic Classifier / \nDilaudid / Neurontin\n \nAttending: ___.\n \nChief Complaint:\nEncephalopathy\n \nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\nLumbar puncture\n\n \nHistory of Present Illness:\nHPI:  Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with metastatic renal cell \ncarcinoma s/p L4-S1 fusion with partial sacrectomy and \nsacro-iliac screw placement in ___ followed by XRT, \ncomplicated by ___ surgical site infection and right iliac bone \npathologic fracture, now presenting with ___ days of lethargy, \npoor PO intake, nausea, vomiting, visual/auditory \nhallucinations, and headache.  He reports acute on chronic \nworsening pain in his hips/legs as well as weakness. He \nacknowledges falls at home and has been using wheelchair to get \naround. He fell in the shower this AM without head trauma after \nhe slipped on a towel; he did not experience any prodrome. He \nstates that he heads sounds sich as a tornado or sparks from \nelectrical wires which he recognizes as not real.  He also \nreports seeing a purple halo around the television set and \noccasionally objects that others do not.

Stable postoperative changes with L4 to S2 posterior fusion \nhardware and partial resection of the sacrum. \n3. Peripherally enhancing small collections are noted in the \nposterior paraspinal soft tissue at S3 level extending to the \nskin which have increased since the prior study. \n.  \nHead CT\nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. If there is \ncontinued clinical concern for intracranial metastasis, \ncontrast-enhanced CT or preferably MR would be more sensitive \nfor detecting metastatic disease. \n  \n2. Evidence of mild paranasal sinus disease. \n  \nSpine MRI\n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No abnormal vertebral or intramedullary enhancement. \n2. Mild enhancement along the surface of the lower thoracic \nspinal cord which \nlikely represents vascular enhancement. However, possibility of \nleptomeningeal \nspread of disease cannot be ruled out. \n3. Moderate degenerative changes in the cervical spine with \nmultilevel neural \nforaminal stenosis and moderate spinal canal stenosis at C4-C5. \n4. Mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine without \nspinal canal or \nneural foraminal stenosis. \n5. No focal signal abnormality noted in the spinal cord. \n  \nHead MRI\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. A small homogenously enhancing extra-axial dural based lesion \nin the left \nmiddle cranial fossa anteriorly. This likely represents a \nmeningioma. However, \npossibility of dural based metastasis cannot be entirely ruled \nout. If prior \nMRI are available, correlation with them may help in confirming \nthe diagnosis. \n2. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage.  \n3. No abnormal parenchymal enhancement.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a ___ year old man admitted to ___ on ___ \nwith metastatic renal cell carcinoma s/p L4-S1 fusion with \npartial sacrectomy and sacro-iliac screw placement in ___ followed by XRT, complicated by ___ surgical site \ninfection and right iliac bone pathologic fracture, now \npresenting with altered mental status, acute kidney injury, and \nfurther progression of his metastatic RCC.\n\nAn MRI of lumber spine showed extension of soft tissue mass into \nspinal canal into the spinal canal. It did not show any \nsignificant findings within the thoracic or cervical spine. A \nhead MRI showed possible evidence of cancer spread -> ? \nmeningioma vs mets. \n\nThe team was hesitant to pursue an LP given the location of his \nabscess. It was discussed thoroughly with the interventional \nradiology team and they did not feel that there was a safe \nwindow to pursue an LP, and also were not comfortable attempting \na cervical level spinal tap. Given the concern for \nleptomeningeal spread, and the inconclusive MRI, the team \ndecided to pursue an LP above the level of abscess. An LP was \ncompleted at the L2-L3 level which showed total protein of 199*, \nbut no signs of infection. \n\nIt is difficult to say whether or not the intracranial lesion in \nthe patient's brain is benign versus mets without previous \nstudies to compare. The CSF studies suggest leptomeningeal \nspread with such a high protein level; however, we will need to \nwait for flow cytometry to be completed to know for sure.\n\nThe patient's calcium level was elevated with a low phosphorus. \nHis PTH was low at only 8. Our thoughts are an ectopic source of \nPTHrP causing the hypercalcemia. This is a sendout lab and was \npending at the time of discharge. To mention, ectopic PTHrP has \nbeen found in up to 15% of ___ patients. The patient received \nIVFs throughout his stay, and also dose of IV pamidronate. He \nwas also started on calcitonin briefly to assist in bringing \ndown his calcium levels. \n\nIt was decided to not send him home on cacitonin, but the \npatient will need close followup with his PCP this week to have \nit rechecked. The patient will continue his course of nafcillin \nfor his lumbar abscess at home. He has several appointments to \nbe scheduled after his discharge.   \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n nafcillin 2 gram Recon Soln Sig: One (1)  Intravenous every \nfour (4) hours.\nDisp:*128 doses* Refills:*2*\n- Prevacid 30 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

Despite workup, no cause \nwas found for her fevers; TEE remains to be done outpatient. She \nwas also found to have hematuria with unremarkable sediment.\n\n#Recurrent Fevers\nPatient reported fevers up to ___ for 9 days preceding \nadmission, and 1 week of similar fevers in ___ which was \nattributed to viral illness. There was initial concern for \ntemporal arteritis given L temporal soreness, fevers, and \nelevated CRP/ESR. Rheumatology was consulted and the decision \nwas made to defer steroids as GCA was unlikely (no visual loss, \njaw claudication, progression, or other features c/w \nvasculitis). Malignancy was considered but thought to also be \nless likely given unremarkable differential, absence of LAD, and \nno concerning findings on admission CT chest. Does have a remote \nhistory of breast cancer, but no signs of recurrence, no \nlymphadenopathy. Also closely followed with breast \nMR/mammography. Workup for infection included blood cultures \nwithout growth, CT chest and CXR without acute process, UCx \nwithout growth, skin was unremarkable, and she had no oral \nlesions. The fact that she remained in sinus rhythm after recent \ncardioversion is also somewhat reassuring against infection. She \ndid not experience any other localizing signs or symptoms of \ninfection. Reassuringly, no current stigmata of endocarditis, \nthough could be subacute presentation or localized abscess. She \ndoes meet 2 Duke minor criteria. CTA without signs of PE and \n___ negative for DVT. No signs of infection on CXR and UA \nwithout signs of infection although some hematuria that's been \nimproved. \nShe will have a TEE outpatient, and blood cultures must be \nfollowed up. \n\n#Hematuria\nHematuria on UA with sediment showing elevated RBCs, none \ndysmorphic, no casts. Protein/Cr ratio of 0.3 but improved to \n0.2 on recheck. She has no signs of symptoms of cystitis, though \ndid recently have UTI at rehab s/p antibiotics.

You were found to have pneumonia and you were \ntreated with antibiotics.  We also found that your swallowing \nfunction was no longer safe and that you were at risk of \naspiration.  It is likely that aspiration led to the pneumonia \nthat prompted your admission.\n\nAs a result of your problems swallowing, we also found that your \nnutritional status was not good, so after much discussion with \nyou and your daughter, we placed a gastric feeding tube \n(G-tube), and started tube feeds.  This will allow you to get \nnutrition, hydration, and medications through the tube.  You \nwill continue the tube feeds when you leave the hospital.\n\nYou were also found to have many enlarged lymph nodes throughout \nyour body.  A biopsy was performed that showed that the enlarged \nlymph nodes were likely because of your known multiple myeloma.  \nWe recommend that you follow-up with your \nhematologist/oncologist at ___.\n\nYou were also treated for a sacral ulcer and our nurses have \nbeen changing the dressing to help keep this area clean and dry. \n We also placed a urinary catheter temporarily to help keep the \nwound clean and dry as much as possible.  As the wound heals, \nthe catheter will need to be removed, as it can be an infection \nrisk the longer it stays in place.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

Normal left ventricular wall thickness, \ncavity size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF \n= 63%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are \nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with \ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. \nThe estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n IMPRESSION: No ASD or PFO. Normal global and ___ \nbiventricular systolic function.\"\n\nCAROTID DOPPLERS ___:\n\"IMPRESSION:    \n1.  Complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery \n2.  Less than 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery \nby ultrasound however the CTA from ___ provides better \ndelineation of the anatomy.  Please see report of the CTA for \ncomplete details.\"\n\nMRA NECK (WITH FAT SATS) ___:\n\"IMPRESSION:   \n1. No eccentric T1 hyperintense signal along the course of the \nright internal carotid artery to suggest dissection or mural \nthrombus. \n2. As described on prior CTA head and neck, there is diffuse \nnarrowing of the left cervical internal carotid artery, without \nstenosis by NASCET criteria.  Narrowing of the left A1 and M1 \nsegments is re-identified, better described on CTA head of ___, which may represent ___ syndrome. \n3. Re-identified is an a 3 mm left anterior communicating artery \ncomplex \noutpouching, potentially representing an aneurysm.  Close \nattention on \nfollow-up is advised to document stability. \n4. Enlarged axillary and prominent cervical lymph nodes, which \nmay be \nreactive.  Clinical correlation is recommended.\"\n\n___ ___:\n\"IMPRESSION:   \n1.

Additionally, imaging of \nher brain is suggestive of left-sided ___ placing her at \nincreased risk of vascular insult in the future. She had \nposition dependent symptoms while in the hospital and had \nadditional watershed infarct in the right internal carotid \nartery territory, requiring transfer to the ICU and pressors to \nincrease cerebral perfusion (see below). She was ultimately \nweaned off the pressors, slowly weaned off bedrest, and \nultimately did well. She was started on midodrine to promote \ncerebral perfusion. She was started on dual antiplatelet therapy \nwith aspirin and Plavix given her significant intracranial \natherosclerosis; she will take both for three months then d/c \nPlavix but take ASA indefinitely. Etiology of her carotid \nocclusion is presumed atherosclerosis - no dissection was seen \nand no cardioembolic source was found. The DDx also includes \nvasculopathy but she had no elevation of ESR and CRP to support \nvasculitis diagnosis and normal renal artery u/s speaks against \nfibromuscluar dysplasia. \n\n# HOSPITAL ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: She had cough at presentation \nthough admission CXR was unremarkable. Later, she developed a \nfever and CXR was repeated which showed a new opacity consistent \nwith pneumonia. She was treated for hospital acquired pneumonia \nwith Cefepime and Vancomycin (___) and then was narrowed \nto Ceftriaxone (___).\n\n# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: LDL was elevated to 208. She was started on \natorvastatin.\n\n# ICU COURSE ___\nOn ___, the pt's husband reported that she had a difficult \ntime ambulating to the bathroom in the morning.  Upon exam soon \nafter, she was noted to have left sided hemiplegia and left \nsided neglect, so a STAT NCHCT was completed that showed a new \nright ___ hypodensity near the genu of the corpus \ncallosum suggestive of a new infarct and repeat brain MRI showed \nextension of her infarcts. As a result, she was transferred to \nthe ICU (___) for vasopressor support and close \nmonitoring. During this time, ___ was kept flat and pt received \nIVFs and Phenylephrine to increase SBP to prevent flow-dependent \nischemia. Patient was started on Midodrine for further blood \npressure control as well as Atorvastatin. She was seen to have \nimproved strength in LUE/LLE and ultimately recovered to her \nrecent baseline with mild L sided sensory-motor deficit. She was \nweaned off vasopressors and transferred out of ICU. \n\n___________________________________________________\n___________________________________________________\nTransitional Issues:\n- Began aspirin and Plavix x 3 months.

Study is  degraded by motion, especially on postcontrast \nimages. \n2. Within limits of study, no definite evidence of epidural \nabscess, phlegmon or discitis / osteomyelitis. Recommend \nclinical correlation. If continued concern for diskitis \nosteomyelitis, consider repeat imaging when patient can tolerate \nexamination. \n3. Mild cervical and thoracic lumbar spondylosis as described \nabove. \n4. Lumbar spondylosis, with grade 1 anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 \nand L5 on S1. There are bilateral pars fractures at L3-L4 and \nlikely pars fractures at L5-S1. There is moderate left worse \nthan right neural foraminal narrowing at L3-L4. \n\n___ CXR\nIMPRESSION: \nCardiomediastinal contours are normal. Lung volumes are slightly \nlow, \nresulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  With this \nlimitation in mind, there are no focal areas of consolidation to \nsuggest the presence of pneumonia, and no pleural effusions are \ndetected. \n\n___ Right fingers x-ray\nIMPRESSION:  \nMild to moderate thumb interphalangeal joint degenerative \nchange. There is some associated soft tissue swelling. \nInflammatory or infectious process is not excluded, but no \nspecific features for this are demonstrated. If persistent \nconcern, cross-sectional imaging or joint aspiration can be \nperformed. \n\n___ TTE\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and \nno aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve \nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. \nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen \non the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \npressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant valvular \ndisease seen. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction.  \n\n___ CT Abd/pelvis - second opinion\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Review of the medical record \nstates that the patient is being evaluated for a septic joint. \nThe lymphadenopathy may be due to a generalized infectious \nprocess. However differential diagnosis includes lymphoma and 3 \nmonths followup CT is recommended to ensure resolution of the \nlymphadenopathy \n2. Indeterminate hypodense lesion in the liver statistically \nmost likely \nrepresents a hemangioma. MRI could be considered for further \nevaluation if warranted. \n3. Subcentimeter hypodense lesion in the left kidney is too \nsmall to \ncharacterize but likely represents a cyst \n4. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis is likely \nphysiologic if the \npatient is premenopausal. Please correlate with patient's \nmenstrual history. \n\n___ Knee, bilateral\nIMPRESSION:  \nBilateral effusions greater on the left. Soft tissue swelling \nmedial to the left knee. Minimal degenerative changes on the \nleft. \n\n___ Lower extremity ultrasound\nIMPRESSION:  \nNo evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower \nextremity veins. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ y/o typically healthy female with a history \nof asthma who initially presented to ___ on ___ with fever, \nmalaise, and aches who now represents with ongoing fevers, ___ \nweakness and bilateral knee effusions.\n\n# Fever with polyarticular arthritis: Patient presented with \nrecurrent fevers and bilateral knee effusions with associated \ndecrease in range of motion and weakness in her lower \nextremities. The differential for this was broad. Could be \nrelated to viral illness (e.g. parvovirus), bacterial infection \n(patient with high fevers and rigors rising concern for \nbacteremia and ___ positive blood cultures) vs tick-borne \nillness (negative parasite smear) vs. malignancy (in the setting \nof retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy) vs. secondary to \nrheumatologic process. Arthrocentesis performed in the ___ \nshowed right knee with 40,000 WBC and 16,000 RBC and left knee \nwith 32,000 WBC and 2200 RBC. Though this was not quite in range \nfor septic arthritis, it was felt to be possible since she did \nreiceve one dose ceftriaxone at ___ before arhtrocentesis \nwas performed in ___. Due to suspicious for septic \narthritis, she was empirically covered with vancomycin and \nceftriaxone from ___ while awaiting culture data. Her \narthrocentesis gram stain and culture remains negative, however, \nand ___ blood cultures positive from ___ with \ncoagulase-negative staphylococcus, which was felt to represent \ncontamination. Due to unusual presentation of bilateral joint \neffusions concerning for spetic arthritis, she underwent TTE to \nrule out endocarditis; however this showed no vegetations. She \nwas also seen by Rheumatology consult. Multiple lab tests for \nRheumatologic work-up were sent (e.g. ___, anti-dsDNA, \n___, anti-CCP antibody), but none came back positive. \nInfectious Disease consultation recommended discontinuing \nantibotics, which was done on ___. She was afebrile off of \nantibiotics, and range of motion in both knees improved over \ntime, as did her strength (of note, CK was WNL). She did have a \nvery elevated CRP, however, with low ESR, in conjunction with \nprominent effusions of both knees, which was puzzling to all \nteams in terms of elucidating the etiology of her illness. Her \neffusions and pain limited her mobility, so she worked with \nPhysical Therapy to improve her strength and balance. Overall, \nshe likely had post-infectious arthritis (inciting source is \nunclear, but her history is notable for a likely \nviral-prodrome); her response was somewhat consistent with \nviral-mediated vs reactive arthritis. She had been afebrile for \nmultiple days on discharge, and was not requiring analgesia. She \nwas asked to use tylenol and NSAIDs for pain control, and \nfollow-up with Rheumatology as an outpatient.\n\n# Rash: Patient presented with a rash consisting of \nerythematous, non-pruritc macules and papules spread over her \nanterior chest and her extensor surfaces, especially on her \nupper thighs. This was felt to be likely a viral exanthem given \ndiffuse involvement without pruritus in setting of acute illness \nvs. drug rash in setting of exposure to cephalexin (given \neosinophilia and improvement once cephalexin was stopped). This \nwas not a typical plaque with eczematous rash as can be seen in \nreactive arthritis, or in sun-exposed areas as would be seen in \nlupus. Possibilities also included salmonella rash (light pink, \nover anteiror chest near shoulder), but stool culture was \nnegative. On discharge, her rash was resolving and beginning to \nfade.\n\n# Thrombocytopenia: Admitted with placelet count of 118. Likely \ndecreased production due to viral illness versus acute \ninfection. No splenomegaly on recent imaging. Thin and thick \nsmear negative for parasite. No spherocytes or schistocytes on \nsmear. Resolved on discharge.\n\n# Normocytic anemia: Patient is a menstruating female, but \narrived with hemoglobin of 11.6 on admission. Iron studies were \nconsistent with anemia of chronic disease, especially given \nferritin > 90. No evidence of schistocytes on smear. This was \ntrended and stable.\n\n# Retroperitoneal Lymphadenopathy: Noted on CT at ___ done on \n___. This was felt to be mild and non-specific. While it is \nrare, hematologic malignancy (lymphoma) can present with \nretroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Her LDH was normal, and HIV \nnegative. Urinalysis showed mildly active sediment. Overall, \nthis was felt to be reactive lymphadenopathy in the setting of \ninfection. The patient should have repeat imaging done to assess \nfor resolution in 3 months, however.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- low vitamin D (9), started repletion with 50,000 units weekly \nstarting ___\n- consider work-up for hypovitaminosis D with PTH, anti-tTG \nantibody\n- 3 months followup CT of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended \nto ensure resolution of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy \n- consider MRI to evaluate likely liver hemangioma\n- Labs pending at discharge: MI-2 AUTOANTIBODIES, PRE-ALBUMIN\n- CODE STATUS: Full (confirmed)  \n- CONTACT: Primary - ___, daughter ___ Secondary - \n___, husband, ___ \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

At the hospital, we drained \nfluid from your knees and you felt a little bit better. Our \ndoctors examined ___, and we got a chest x-ray which was normal, \nand an x-ray of your thumb. Although we did not find a specific \nculprit behind your symptoms, we believe that your illness was \ncaused by an infection that led to what is called a \n\"post-infectious arthritis\". Your symptoms should continue to \nimprove over time. As a result, we are sending you home with a \nprescription for naproxen to help control your pain.\n\nWe also found that you are deficient in Vitamin D during this \nhospitalization. We recommend that you take 50,000 units of \nvitamin D once a week, and follow-up with your primary care \nphysician regarding this issue.\n\nYou were incidentally noted to have enlarged lymph nodes in your \nabdomen, which may have been caused by your recent infection.  \nRadiology recommends a repeat CT of your abdomen in 3 months \ntime to ensure resolution of these enlarged lymph nodes.  If \nthey persist, further workup may need to be done.\n\nWe ask that you take your medications, and follow up with your \nproviders as below.\n\nWe wish you all the best!\n-Your ___ Care Team \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

We think this is due to AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY, a condition \nwhere abnormal protein deposits in the blood vessels. The brain \nis the part of your body that controls and directs all the other \nparts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived \nof its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. Your \nEEG did not show any evidence of seizures. \n Because these events can happen again, and can potentially \nleave permanent deficits, we need to do everything we can to \nprevent them. You will need strict management of your blood \npressure. Please purchase a blood pressure cuff at your nearest \npharmacy and start measuring your blood pressure daily.  Your \nsystolic blood pressure (the top number) goal is <140. Keep a \nlog of your blood pressures and bring them to every appointment. \n We also recommend a heart healthy diet (low fat, low salt), \ndaily exercise, and stress reduction techniques. Please avoid \nlifting more than 10 pounds at a time. You should also avoid \nsituations that would put you at high risk for falling and \ncausing a bleed. You should stop taking aspirin. You should also \navoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or \nnaproxen (use tylenol instead). Please follow up with your \nprimary care physician in the next ___ weeks. Your appointment \nin the stroke clinic is listed below.\n\nIt was a pleasure meeting you!\nYour ___ Neurology Team\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n\n \nName:  ___                   Unit No:   ___\n \nAdmission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___\n \nDate of Birth:  ___             Sex:   F\n \nService: NEUROLOGY\n \nAllergies: \nSulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Penicillins\n \nAttending: ___\n \nChief Complaint:\nR temporal/parietal IPH with SDH and ___\n \nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\nNone\n\n \nHistory of Present Illness:\n___ is a ___ year old female with HTN, HLD,\nhypothyroidism, arrhythmia NOS on no anticoagulation but on ASA\n81mg, anxiety and history of atraumatic SAH in ___ likely\nsecondary to amyloid presenting with acute onset headache, \nnausea\nand left side paralysis.\n\nMs. ___ reports that she woke up this morning on ___ at\n7:00am in her usual state of health, but while taking a shower\nand brushing her teeth at around 7:10am, she noted that she had\nsudden onset headache, nausea and her left arm felt heavy.

Neurosurgery was consulted and did not \nrecommend surgical intervention.  \n\nInitally patient's exam was notable for L sided hemiplegia, loss \nof sensation on L, L facial droop, mild anisicoria and right \nsided gaze preference.  Mental status was initially intact but \npt became more somnolent after admission.  Repeat scan 8 hours \nlater demonstrated enlarging right frontoparietal parenchymal \nhematoma.  Similarly sized right cerebral subdural hematoma, \nwith tiny subarachnoid and intraventricular components.  Mild \nprogression in leftward subfalcine herniation.
