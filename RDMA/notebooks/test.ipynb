    "text =  \"A 35-year-old woman presented to the medical emergency department with low-grade fever for 3 weeks, vomiting for 1 week and anuria for 3 days. She also reported dysuria and breathlessness for 1 week. There was no history of decreased urine output, dialysis, effort intolerance, chest pain or palpitation, dyspnoea and weight loss. Menstrual history was within normal limit but she reported gradually progressive loss of appetite. Family history included smoky urine in her younger brother in his childhood, who died in an accident. On general survey, the patient was conscious and alert. She was dyspnoeic and febrile. Severe pallor was present with mild pedal oedema. Blood pressure was 180/100 mm Hg and pulse rate of 116/min regular. No evidence of jaundice, clubbing cyanosis or lymphadenopathy was found. Physical examination revealed bibasilar end-inspiratory crepitations in lungs and suprapubic tenderness. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or ascites. Cardiac examination was normal. She was found to have severe bilateral hearing loss, which was gradually progressive for 5 years. The fundi were bilaterally pale. The patient was referred to the department of ophthalmology for a comprehensive eye examination. Her visual acuity was documented as 6/18 in both eyes with no obvious lenticular opacity. Slit-lamp examination showed bilateral anterior lentiglobus with posterior lenticonus. Distant direct ophthalmoscopy revealed oil droplet sign (a suggestive confirmation of the presence of lenticonus); and peripheral retina revealed multiple yellowish white lesion-like flecks in the mid-periphery, and few blot haemorrhages indicative of hypertensive changes. Haemogram showed haemoglobin (Hb) 5.7 g/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 15 mm in first hour, white cell count 17 200/\\u00b5L with 82% polymorphs, adequate platelets and mean corpuscular volume 83.3 fL. Peripheral smear showed normocytic normochromic anaemia with mild anisocytosis. Fasting sugar 78 mg/dL, blood urea 325 mg/dL, serum creatinine 11.2 mg/dL and uric acid 8.3 mg/dL. Liver function tests were within normal limit as were serum electrolytes, except serum calcium (conc.) 5.8 mg/dL (adjusted with serum albumin). Lipid profile and iron profile were also normal. HIV and viral markers for HbsAg and hepatitis C virus were non-reactive. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with features of left ventricular hypertrophy and chest X-ray posteroanterior view revealed cardiomegaly. Urinalysis showed full field of pus cells with 35\\u201340 RBCs/hpf and 3(+) proteinuria. Urine samples for cultures were sent which reported pure growth of Escherichia coli. Spot urine for protein:creatinine ratio was 2.07 g/g Cr. She underwent pure tone audiometry which revealed features suggestive of severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SHNL). Ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral contracted kidneys: right measured 6.7\\u00d72.3 cm and left 7.8\\u00d73 cm, with increased cortical echogenecity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation, suggestive of medical renal disease. Two-dimensional Echo reported dilated left ventricular cavity with mild mitral regurgitation and ejection fraction of 55%. Renal and skin biopsies were conducted and specimens were sent for light and electron microscopy (EM). Renal tissue on H&E stain was reported as focal segmental glomerulonephritis (FSGS). Ultrathin sections of EM study of renal tissue revealed disruption of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) with diffuse thickening of glomerular capillary wall. Dermal tissue depicted discontinuity of lamina densa with basket weaving pattern under EM.\"\n",
